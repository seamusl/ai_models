C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Never had that dream.
Ohh.
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
I say push her down the stairs.
What, like there's a rule or something?
Hey, Paul!
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
What's this?
Done with the bookcase!
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Shut up!
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea-Angela-Andrea... Oh man,
Congratulations.
Morning, Paul.
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Look, it was a job all right?
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
...Are we still talking about sex?
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
...Well, this is still ruined, right?
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Thanks! Let's keep going.
What?
Hey!
Y'miss it?
Y'okay, Phoebe?
So when do we get to meet the guy?
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Oh, you do, do you?
What's going on?
Oh, God!
Okay!
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
We love you, man.
What's wrong with the twentieth?
C'mon, Ross!
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
Peaches?
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
With Carol? Oh.
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
No plans, huh?
My god, Angela.
You look good.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
What?
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
Yep.
No, but he's...
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Come on, they're close.
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Ow!
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
Excellent.
Whadja think?
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
I couldn't do it.
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then I'm his butt.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Nope.
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Yeah? That's so nice!
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
We have a winner!
You and Rachel.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Yeeeaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Do you want any help?
OK.
You can't go out there.
I, um, can't tell you.
He's planning your birthday party.
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
Bwah-hah-hah!
Not me.
You guys okay?
Morning. We ready to go?
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
Just a, uh... hearing disability.
Ooh, look look! I got Monica naked!
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
Yeah.
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
What's wrong?
Wait, wait, wait!
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
The balloon?
That tone will not make me go any faster.
Nope, not that one.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
I've gotta see this. Alright Ugly Naked Guy!
The bigger half.
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Nice shoes, huh?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
You seen Sandy?
no no no, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Uhhhh... I'll just pee in the street.
Right. No big deal.
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
You don't think my mom's sexy?
He forgot to leave his grip size!
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Me neither, y'know what
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
No, no. He said When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?
That makes more sense.
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Need a new table.
How'd you get to that?
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Why not?
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Or an uncle...
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
I don't know, birds just don't say, Hello, sit here, eat something.
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
No no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
What?
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Since then?!
You're one to talk.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool... This blows!
Night, you guys.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Who-ah-ho.
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
No.
Thanks, Chandler.
Ma! What're you doing here?
Hold on, you knew?
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
With this ring? No contest.
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
You're in!
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Pathetic mess? I know, but come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Thank you.
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
It's creamier.
Uh-oh.
Whoaa! You cuddled? How many times?
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Alright, now you say something.
You want to see her again, right?
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Say it... say it!
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
What a tool!
Alright, Ross!
You cuddled.
There's the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
I'm sayin' I see a difference.
Yeah.
Nope.
Not from where I was standin'.
She is so hot!
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Cool, thanks.
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Yep. Ice Capades.
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Out.
Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, okay?
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Your sister stood me up the other night.
Urse...
No, no, no, don't say listen. I know that listen. I've said that listen.
You don't drink.
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
We just got the message.
Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.
Thank you.
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
About what?
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out.
Check.
Here, I got five, I got five.
Oh!
Suck-fest.
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
She really said that?
How could you lose him?
Marcel?
A monkey.
Oh. Then, no.
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Her answer machine?
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
He's back! The peeper's back!
Yeah?
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Big day.
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Where've you been?
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
Excellent dream score.
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
How young is young Ethan? Young?
Alright, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Hey, hey. How was the first day?
My scones.
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
What about Andre?
Uh, moist, yeah.
For the ride.
Do we have to know about that?
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Hey, listen, lady...whoa.
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
Tribbiani.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Oh, it is.
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was just yeah, right. Push! Push!
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
He doesn't do much, does he?
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Oh, just, y'know... science.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Oh, OK.
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
The country?
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
What do you mean?
: That book got me through some tough times.
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
He's right, 'cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
How do you mean?
She's still asleep.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
I know! Neither did I!
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Um, this?
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. Alright, when was 1990?
no no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
How're you doing?
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Frankie? What're you talking about?
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
I gotta get one, too.
Uh, does it hurt?
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
What's he doin' in my section?
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
What is the big deal?
Exactly.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
Yeah I guess you're right.
Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
You guys are messin' with me, right?
Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!
Check this out. Can I have this?
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
That's what it says.
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
Oh, yeah.
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
Foxy lady.
I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am...
I got time.
Do we need a cake?
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
For Ross.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Cool.
What are these, like famous chickens?
Thank you.
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
Yeah.
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Fine.
Nooo.
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
And you feel like we hold you back.
Cool.
Are you ok, Ross?
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
Consider it done.
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. Alright, gimme the baby.
You wanna smell him?
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
I'm him.
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
Ahh!
You got a better idea?
Yes! Whew!
Yes! There's still pie.
The guy still won't put out, huh?
Maybe he's... gay.
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh...?
What?
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
Alright Phoebs, way to go.
And what did he say?
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Tongue?
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
You got all that from saline solution?
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. Alright, Rachel first.
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
Oh, yeah, I do.
Hey.
You gave him cookies?
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
C'mon show us what you bought... You know you want to.
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
She told us.
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Hey, here she comes.
Hey.
Hey.
Good luck Phoebs.
Phoebs, what's goin' on?
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
Ooh.
Hey.
With a man?
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
OK, uh... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
Hey.
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Sorry.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Hey.
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
Sooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
There's my scene, there's my scene. Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
Alright, all right. dammit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
They didn't fight a lot?
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
How's that pig in the blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
No, my first fan mail.
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
Let's get out of here.
She's comin'.
Erica.
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
Uhh, 'cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
Hey I
dammit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
It's not what you think, that was...
Somebody wanna help me out here?
I'm not Drake.
Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
This is amazing.
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Ooh.
Forget about it.
So what're you guys gonna eat?
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
Well, let me see.
Chandler's wearing panties.
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
aaagggghhhh.
Hey.
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, y'know, always bein' there for me.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
You know what the...
How come you have two?
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
What is with your nose?
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Alright open your eyes.
I know.
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one.
We dare.
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
It certainly is a miracle.
Naa, she's lyin'.
Cool.
What?
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
So where you gettin' it?
Can you believe this place?
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Well that's how I feel.
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened...
No, we're alright.
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
Yes! And the table is mine.
Oh no no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
So, I guess this is it.
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
Art.
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?
That's right, I have a phone in here.
Hello.
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
Oh, well great.
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
Hey, hey, they're runnin'
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Wow.
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Eddie.
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
It may not be a bed of roses.
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
Ooh, I look good.
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
How can they do this to me?
Hey.
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
No, I don't. It's like, y'know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Y'know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Hey.
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Alright. Cab driver number two?
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
What is it?
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
That's a two line part.
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
Well don't just say.
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
What?
What?
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Thanks Ross.
I didn't get it.
Huh?
I can't watch this.
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
I know I would.
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
What happened to the foosball?
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Hey.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
Ok.
Ok. He kept my dollar.
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
Man you are incredible.
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, y'know, but Richard is just ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
Nooo.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
Monica, relax, go get a beer.
You're kiddin'.
Do what?
Yeah good luck, good luck.
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
That is so not my motto.
Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
By someone besides Monica?
Excellent.
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
Right this is staging.
Quick volleyball question.
Ahh, you drive safe.
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Oh no, what happened?
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Hey.
Hey and everybody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
I figure my character has kids.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Y'know what? Just did.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Sir.
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Y'know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
You see this, this is a friend.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Come on, quite yankin' me.
Okay. Alright. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. Alright?
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's just a lot to take, you know.
Look, what do you want me to say?
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
Okay. I'm in.
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Glass of fat?
Am I in it?
What?
But then you left.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
Oh my, would you look at that!
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
Now she sounded breezy.
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
Where's my underwear?!
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Hey, opposite, is opposite!
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
Yaaay!
WHOAA!
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
What is this? Fruit?
This will just be my batch.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Aww. Ohh!
No more jam?!
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Hey.
Sperm or regular?
Sounds nice.
No, I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
Yeah!
Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day..
Did I get it?
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Yep, that's my audition.
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
Hang up, hang up.
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Hey, you know about that?!
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
Thank you so much.
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Nooo, four.
Pheebs! There you are!
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
I'm, I'm okay. See.
They actually said that?
Okay, shoot.
Okay, what else?
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
You do, thanks.
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Hey!
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
Her what?
It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you?
I know.
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
Why don't we just go on two.
Alright, but in the future...
Wow, it's big!
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Y'know what?
Get out your checkbook, mister.
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Hey, there's a dog out there!
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
Hey!
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Gotcha.
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Oh right, right.
Baywatch.
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Hey, you guys!
I got a gig!
Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. Alright, moving right along.
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
You want me to lie to Chandler?
Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
Hey now!
Okay, great.
Alright. I can't see.
Hey.
You bet! What's the part?
Whoa. That was really good.
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
Alright, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
What did they do?
I've got a science question.
Hey, I'm not judging.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
You said number two.
Uh.
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
Great, you can cover Chandler.
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. Alright, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Alright, we have to pick captains.
Alright, huddle up, right over here.
Set...hike!
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
Mar-klan.
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Pheebs, run!
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
Okay.
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
What? Me having a job?
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Sure.
Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
Well, they go into the chipper.
Alright, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
Not a problem.
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in a can! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine..., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!
Alright, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
Alright, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know...
Chandler!
No, only for sex.
Can I talk to you for a second?!
I just got off the phone with my sister.
Yeah.
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
What's goin' on?
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary Angela.
Cookie, now you can punch him!
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
What?
The what?
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyysss, you've got to pick a pocket or two...
Excellent, I'll be there.
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Whoa, I'm not done.
Mark's a genius!
So, does that mean the audition is off?
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Alright, you got it.
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
These little women. Wow!
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
Hey! How's it going?
Ooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
Beth, Beth dies?
Then why would you say that?!
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
Okay.
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Phew, close one.
Is ah, is Chandler around?
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
I ran!
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
Yeah. You okay?
Where have you been?
Done.
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
We'll be there.
0.1875
She was kidding about that right?
Dude, I don't know.
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Awful! Horrible!
Ewwwww!
Why not?! I'm hungry.
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
Maybe she killed him?
Can I see the comics?
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
I had the same dream!
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
You're smoking again?!
It'll be great for next weekend.
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
What? Mine aren't tinted.
What's going on?
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
What?
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
what's so funny?
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say,?Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,? remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say,?Nah, let's just hang out at your place.? Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Now, what, what is that like?
Well, I want it!
Then you hold on to it!
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
Good. Hey.
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
Yeah, that was real.
Wow, what do you think she wants?
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
Yeah.
It does in mine!
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
Ah, Kate?
Hey, listen you ah...
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
Oh, you have no idea. and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Hey, Kate!
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
What?!
Yeah?
Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
What?
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
Okay.
I don't know.
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
Yeah.
Hey.
No no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I was there, you're not that good an actress.
Hi, Lauren.
Oh my.
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Oh, well no problem there.
How's she doing?
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
Hey! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
What about the chick?
Sure.
Hey.
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
Okay. Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
I wasn't in that.
Yeah.
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
Yes! Ha-ha-ha!
Hey! Are you okay?
Oh, classy.
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
No. Why?
I know! That's why they trashed me!
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
What?
Two brothers, one died!
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it was ugly.
What?!
When is she leaving?
Hey!
But, but what about us?
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I wanna say good bye.
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
What was it?
Yeah, right.
Hey.
Well what is it?!
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
Oh no no, I meant Chandler.
Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Tell us!
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
Fight's over!
No-o-o!
Well, I think we all learned something.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
No, it's just my luggage.
Hey, check out the hat!
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
Okay, all right.
OH YES!
Alright, relax. It's just a shoe.
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
What's the matter, Pheebs?
But I made cards!
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
...and he couldn't let it go, and... I don't really know what happened with that either.
Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
What?! What?! What is it?!
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Me too.
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
Nope.
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
Looks good, uh?
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
What? What's wrong?
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Good for you!
Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
Okay. See?! I told ya!
WHAT?!
aww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!
I was tryin' to make a sale! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!
Huh?!
Just pickle.
Uhhhh.
Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
I'm out.
In the woods. No wait wait, that's the joke answer.
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
what's going on?
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Alright that's it, school is in session!
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted I'll see you later.
Alright! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
Noo-no no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
yeah yeah, absolutely.
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
Alright, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he! Hey!
What?
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
Hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. Alright, it's like a sport, it's manly!
I don't know how to lead.
So you ah, ready for our last practice?
We did it!
Oh well, okay, good luck.
Okay.
Really?
Hey!
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Hey.
Hey!
It's 4:30.
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
I'll be right back. What was that?
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Hey!
You can pee here!
Oh, I know...
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over... Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
Yeah.
Alright, so... next time, you take her to your place.
Alright, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Yeah!
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Hey!
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon..
Great! Alright, so I'll call you later.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
You got all that from the back of her head?
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Well, you're amazing.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
no no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
No. No, Kathy.
Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
What's up?
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
no no, no it's uh, it's okay.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
What?
What?! That's even worse!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Hello.
Stop callin'!
Hey!
No! I'm putting that in my room.
Five years.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
What?
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
We've got a box.
Ewwwww! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Chandler?
He's doin' some thinkin'!
That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
Alright, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Hey.
In the box.
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
Alright, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
I think I know that girl.
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
No, I had sex in high school.
Really?!
I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
Yeah!
Alright, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
Thank God! I'm exhausted!
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
Ohhh!
Good enough to get fired.
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Damn!
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
There's like there's like 300 bucks in this one!
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Lean-lean-lean!
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Huh.
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
Well, how come?
I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I saved you seat.
Whatever.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
Good luck. And I'm still right!
Yeah, what's that about?
Six.
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
No no, not for like another two weeks.
No! Alright,who who makes up the questions?
I know.
The Irish gig guy?!
Nana?
I took a shot.
What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
Dah!
Okay.
Weekend at Bernie's.
Guest.
I call Monica's room!
What?
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
But it is our apartment!
Hey!
I think I left a donut up here.
that that is a good trick.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Nooo!
Yep! Grab a plate.
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Alright Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Wow! The new Playboy!
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, Hey, how you doin'?
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
What the heck is that?
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
I don't know, it looks the same.
How'd it go?
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, Joey, what are you doing with your life? stuff. I can say, Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Yeah.
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
Hey buddy! How's it going?
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
No no, it's uh, it's Heston.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
How ya doin'?
no no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
I wanted to go to the strip club!
Ohh, Nothing.
Like this.
Hey! Ah!
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Hey! What's up?
Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Thanks for telling me!
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Ross! They're gonna kill you!
Ross Ross-Ross Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one Dude! They're all huge!
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
Yeah, sure.
Yeah?
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
Yeah, what' going on?
what is so funny?
A little salami.
Yeah.
There was a seen in Footloose...
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
Alright look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
Feel better now?
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Take the bra off.
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
What is that?
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Hey.
Yeah right.
Hey!
You play hard to get.
Way to be strong, man!
Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
Hey.
Noo! Nothing!
One.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Hey!
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. Where is everybody? Well, they're hanging out with Joey.
What do ya say? What do ya say?
Hey!
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
I'm sorry man, I didn't I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
It's not that bad.
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
What's up with Gene?
Ohh!
See, this is a great apartment.
You have Knicks tickets?
Yeah!
Yeah, you do!
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Hey!
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Alright look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
Wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
It's the Knicks!
Huh.
Done!
Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Okay!
Uhh, they're tall.
Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't.
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!
I don't want to move again!
Good night.
Yeah! Yeah!
Hey! Get into gear!
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a Quit being a baby and leave me alone clinic!
Ohhh, yeah!
That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
So why don't you give me your number?
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Everybody's doing stuff!
no no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Hey!
We could get that Everest video though.
Yeah. Yeah.
It's never gonna happen.
Awful! Horrible!
Ewwwww!
Hey!
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is goood!
Whoa-whoa whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Come on Ross! Look, I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
What about me?! you just said I could!
Yes! Shame about you man.
Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
Are you strippers?
Oh-whoa, what party?
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Alright oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
You got it.
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Oh-whoa wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
Oh-oh!
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. Alright. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. Alright.
Oh yeah yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
Hey, stripper!
The ring is gone!
Of course!
Hey...
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, If I bothered them again they'd call the police. I said, If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
If anything should happen to him...
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
H-h-h-how's the duck?
No, it's not. I mean you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Now, don't argue with me...
I gotta go check something over here.
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
Woo-hoo!
London baby!
London baby!
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. Alright, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
I got it! Here we go.
Alright! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Oh, I embarrass you?
Thanks.
Oh. Sorry!
Noo! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
That's Fergie baby!
Wait up!
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
Who's seven?
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
Hello?
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
But, he loves Emily?
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Hey.
What?
I know! That's why we got to find Monica! You know where she is?
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
Ah, I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her Hey. And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
You spit on me man!
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Can I ask you something?
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Hi!
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Mornin' Pheebs!
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
I bet it was about her a little.
Hey, Pheebs!
Havin' some trouble?
Alright. Good deal.
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Yeah, all of us! All day!
Mine!
Which, is the new plan!
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeee!
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Not in my head.
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
I think Saturday .
Umm, well, what else could it be?
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Ohh, get these things out of me!
Argh!
Oh my God.
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Hey!
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
That's because all people are selfish.
That he doesn't exist.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
Hello New York!
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
PBS Telethon.
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
But it's dark out.
Hey!
Hi!
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Hey, you're back!
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Nooo! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
You're not gonna like it.
I told ya.
Hi, Rach.
Hey, you're not Kip!
Oh, that poor bastard.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
Ooh! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!
You?! and you?!
IN LONDON!
Alright! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
I guess I'm done.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
I can still hear you!
Argh-argh! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? Alright, what do you think?
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-Owww! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
Yeah!
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
I'm not sure.
Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
No, look.
Why?
Yeah.
Ross?
Hey, all right!
Hey.
Kinda.
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Ahhhh...
No no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
No, the quiet down thing!
Alright, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Um-hmm.
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Umm, yum!
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Hey, let's go look at it!
Yeah!
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Oh, it's perfect!
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Yeah!
Oh! Oh!
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
You're kidding!
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
Alright!
I need something sweet.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
Phoebe?
I know! It's stuck!
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
I can't! It's stuck!
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. Alright? Remember when Ross tried to say, Butternut squash? And it came out, Squatternut buash?
Yeah, they're mine.
Chandler? A word.
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
Oh-oh, yeah yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Didn't think so.
What's wrong buddy?
So you uh, still wondering?
Oh no no, wait wait wait!
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Oh no no! no no!
Thank you!
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
I slept with Monica.
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
Uhh, Monica?
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? Alright, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
Why are you doing this?
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here... sit down. Ready? Ahh! Ohh, yeah! Huh?!
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29 year old Italian actor from Queens.
Okay, is there anything else?
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
I can't write! Y'know I mean i'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Thanks!
It's not.
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
You're driving me crazy with that!
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Alright! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
Yeah, I think we said goodbye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Hey!
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Come on look guys, don't fight.
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
Oh no! No no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
No no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
What?! Wait-wait wait! The handsome man was about to enter!
What's the matter?!
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
Chandler.
Yeah.
Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
So did that do anything for ya?
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
See ya! Alright Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
No.
Yeah!
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
G-sharp.
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!
Uhh, Chandler's not here.
Nice!
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
what is it, what is it?
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
I'm not listening to you!
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
Was the chord at least right...
Umm?
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Do you know something?
What's the thing you know?
Okay, fine.
YOU KNOW!
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
I don't know.
I don't know.
They did it right there on the couch.
Anybody gonna eat that?
Really?
Alright, let's go Pheebs.
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
He hooked up! Tell us about her!
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Alright, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Judge rules, no violation.
What?!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Umm, hi.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Alright.
Pheebs! Sorry!
Alright, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
It looks like a women's purse.
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Hey!
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
U-N-I-sexy?
Here, I brought you some flowers.
What did you say to him?
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. Alright? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
I mean if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
Nooo. no no, these babies sell themselves.
Okay! Alright, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
Estelle said I didn't get it.
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
What? What?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
I can't take any...
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Yeah?
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
I'm listening.
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
They know you know.
Hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Ooh!
It's not my first time.
Alright! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey, i'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
So, are you ready to go?
I was thinking Chinese food.
She keeps punching me.
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
No no.
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Hey! Hiya!
Uhh...
What a bad idea!
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
That's not funny at all!
What are you guys doing up?
Aww, you guys are so cute!
Hey, you guys!
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends-and I'm not him.
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
Nothing!
Well, it involved Monica.
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Not really.
Friends first? That's interesting.
How you doin'?
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Won't-won't that take longer?
Hey!
Uhh, well, she's... really good in bed.
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
Alright! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Uhh, just a minute officer!
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Yeah, i'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, i'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
This is your place?
Ugh!
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
You kissed him?!
Yeah! No?
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Dahhhh! No! Nooo!
Alright now, memorize it. You got it?
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
Luck!
Ross! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!
They're gonna do it together.
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
What?! Are you kidding?!
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad...
I look more like him than you do!
Yeah I did!
Who knows?
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
You just give him a spoon baby!
Yeah?! So's yours!
Oh yeah, no problem.
Ross!
Uh-oh.
Oh, what did I say?
Hmm, noodle soup.
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
Hey.
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, Hmm, noodle soup.
Wait-whoa whoa, you lost me.
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
True story!
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
Alright, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Yeah, all right. Ooh!
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Alright back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Somebody help me out here!
I want to go on a ride along!
Oh-ho, yeah!
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Did I say you could smell it?!
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Yeah, what's that like?
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Is everything okay?
Hi.
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Is something wrong?
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Well, no, not exactly! Alright, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. Alright? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
No! I would never do that! you you're like my brother!
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
See?
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Hey, what time is it?
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Hey!
That, is not a cat!
It's not a cat!
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Uh-oh.
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Hi!
Oh, I don't know... Yeah, can't do it.
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Oh yeah, that's right!
I don't know who made you the boss? Alright? We invented this game!
Oh hey, here Pheebs.
Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
Yeah, I got too excited!
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, Where's Betsy? Right? And she says, Betsy's been dead for 10 years.
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Oh umm, not go.
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Well, back to square one.
Peanut butter!
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
North route!
Hey man, what's up?
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
What do you like better action or comedy?
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Hey!
Bye-bye!
See ya!
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Dude you said, No!
I don't believe this!
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Not if you're gonna be like this!
Fine! Get out!
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. what is it?
what?! Why?!
What?!
No!
Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Don't come out here!
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Hi!
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Yeah, what's going on?
Aww, there we go.
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Alright well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Can I change a hundred?
Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
My identical hand twin!
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
Pheebs!
Hey you made it!
Who's your friend? He's hot!
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Okay! How you doin'?
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!
Joey!
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Hi!
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
Ahhh!
Ooh-ho-ho!
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!
Hey!
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh ooh! How about you come with me?
Sure?
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
Sure! What's up?
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
What?!
Really? I don't...
Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Yes.
What are you doing?
I'm not finished.
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Okay! Look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!
Really?! Well, when?
Great!
Dude! What are yo you trying to kill me?!
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
Hey, what's up?
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
Whoa! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Why not?!
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda...
Let me see that!
Alright well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Hey Estelle, listen...
Yeah!
Why?
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
Nothing! Well, I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just hold on one second. Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!
Exactly.
Yeah, okay.
Yes!
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
Take good care of your Momma son.
Hey!
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Yeah, it's not mine.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Hey guys!
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Sure!
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Yeah, but it's my wax.
Why not?
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Porsche.
Hey! It's Porsche!
Hey! How you doin'?
Right! And when is that due?
Ahhh.
No no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity... anymore.
This is how much we pay for electric?!
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a looot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
Okay, get ready to owe me!
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Well, what's it called?
Alright.
Really?!
No. Why?
Well, what did you have?
Yeah.
Really?
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
It's him, not it!
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said No, you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's gonna be my new roommate!
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
You're a dancer? she's a dancer!
Of course I did.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Okay!
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
I Gotcha!
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Ohhhh man
Uh-uh nothing. I didn't want you to touch me 'cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
no no I've seen it happen, you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Uh, don't you mean for whom?
Alright, Alright, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Oh!
Oh, I do. How you doin?
Oh dear God!
Sure, neighbor come on in.
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
No.
Alright, you're right. I'll talk to her.
Hmm.
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and... smells different.
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels... Also what is with these chips you bought?
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
Ohh, I love birds.
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it...Oh My God, I'm a women!
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
Okay.
Well maybe I love ya'.
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
Well, this has been great!
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Vomiting stories are funny...
Still not hot enough!
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
I like it.
I wanna gooo!
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
Did she just ask me out on a date?
OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember? stay cool.
Really?
Uh-huh.
No no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
No! Year! Happy No Year!
Yeah?
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
No.
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Okay.
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
Hey! I made that for her!
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
What?
Blah?!
I guess.
Hi!
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
'Kay!
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Because she uh, she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
I can hear you!
So uh, what are you guys doing?
Ha-ha, very funny Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
You don't think I know that!
Oh well then, good night!
Alright! Alright! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! You two go home! I gotta talk to Janine!
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
How ya doin'?
Well, when it's not right, you know it.
What?
Hey guys.
Let's go watch it at your place.

No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Sure.
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
What?!
I finished my book.
Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
You got it.
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
No.
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Exactly! Alright, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so...
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
I'm not answering that.

Do you uh, do you ready for a refill?
It's uh, right through there.
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Come, come here.

Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable!
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
Well, I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.

Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Wow!
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Okay! Alright. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part!

God! Hey, how you doin'?

Hey!
The Mr. Bowmont's here!

Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Well, you know Chandler.
Maybe that's the problem.
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
There are?
Chandler loves marriage!
Where the hell have you been?!
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
I know!
Yeah!
Dude-dude-dude!
Hey!
No we weren't!
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Yeah.
She's gone.
She was all crying. she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Yeah I'll take that.
But I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19 year old. What?
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Come on man, really how old?!
Yeah!
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
I did it anyway.
What?
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Really?
I'm 30!
Psss, that is whack!
Wouldn't she?
They break your heart, don't they?
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
Hey!
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
Well, the duck...
Guys! Guys! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
Alright, I'm gonna go!
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ... wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Where do you think, Zelda?
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Hey Rach.
no no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
Hello, Zelda.
Like a goalie, right?
Huh?
This body?
I don't want to, I'm scared.
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
Ahoy!
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
You could?
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Uhh, rub it?
And deaf!
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
Hey.
Because! You're mean on the boat!
Does a good teacher say, Put down the beer pinhead!?
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
And you'll be nice?
Do you want me to learn?!
Nope.
Huh?
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Why not?!
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
Yeah! Come on.
dammit!
Just pull on it.
Thank you.
What you don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
So, what did you guys think?
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Oh, you weren't finished?
Wow, it's really long.
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Well I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
Okay.
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop this hoop I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
Because they wanted me to audition!
Wait! Terry! Wait Look Wait I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Nothing, why?
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Sure, no problem. Ooh Hey, donuts!
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
Okay, first first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? Alright, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
Hey!
What?
Hey! no no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!
I know, Monica told me.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Yeah, we look great together.
We'll just see.
Die Hard 2.
And?
Well, I don't know!
Yeah. Alright, I'll talk to you later.
Hey! What's going on?
Hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Uh-huh!
Why not?
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
Why is 10 the highest?
I've got cold feet.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, I do when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Wow. Good speech.
And she's back in the game.
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
Pretty good.
Yeah Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Hey! What's up?
Erin! Still here!
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
Bye-bye.
What?!
Man, do you know what guys want!
Look I'm sorry you guys, I just don't think so.
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Erin.
Who's birthday party?
Yeah, look how that worked out.
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
Okay. See you guys later.
Hey!
no no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Oh. Oh.
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Finally!
Fifty-six!
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I forgot-ten-states?
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
What the hell is in there?
Don't do it!
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
Alright, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? Alright? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Ross, you need some help?
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Oh no no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Hey.
Yeah?
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Those two only had each other!
Hey Pheebs?
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
What's up buddy?
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
Hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
Merry Christmas!
Cage closed?
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Hey!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Okay, can I can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
aww! Mel Torme died.
Hey.
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
What do you got there?
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
What's the rush? What?
A date?! No, no Pheebs you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
Fine!
What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
I can give it a shot.
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Come here, check this out!
Y'know, there's two women dude.
I don't know! Yeah, I do.
Oh no! No! No!
Alright well, y'know... I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Alright, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
No.
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
Alright! Just hurry up!
Face to face, yeah!
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
What are you doing?
Rach, there is a decent place to...
No. Rosita does not move.
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
That's true.
No I won't.
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
Can you tell me how this happened?
Someone like an... angel?
Yeah, me too.
No. Really?
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
So, there was no miracle?!
How do you figure?
Yeah! We are!
Ahhh... Eh?
They do!
Why God?! Why?! We had a deal! Let the others grow old! Not me!
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Dude, you sooo need this car.
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
Like what?
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Okay!
I don't like this anymore.
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Hey!
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
Nice.
Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I'm the guy in the coma!
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Umm...
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
See you in 2003.
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye l-l-l-l-l-look the the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
Okay. Okay.
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb Angelina Jolie!
Wow!
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Yeah! Okay.
Hey!
Sure. Yep.
Alright, here we go.
Oh my God!
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
Oh noo...
Great! Hey! Alright! Well-well what is it?!
Ohh. Wow! Well how, how will you be gone?
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again That is I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
I call it!
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
no no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and it would really mean a lot to me.
Alright! Okay! Alright! okay okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Yes!
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, Began their beautiful journey...
Okay. Alright. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
Oh.
Oh.
Hey!
Hey no no! It's cool! It's cool! I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just Where are those condoms you brought?
For just you?
Alright, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!

Hey.
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just... I don't want you to be upset.

Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?
Hey Chandler!
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Two days ago.
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
Yeah well we should order some food then.
Ah yeah wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Yeah. Uh, ... a slice... six dollars?
Hey!
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
I don't know.
Well we'll see!
Kristen?
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Monkey lover!
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!
Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
No! I'm up for a Soapie!
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
And the winner is... Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...

Really?
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
What you don't think I'm gonna win?
Hey!
Ah.
Whoa!
How'd you get over that teacher?
This is it! This is my category.
Yeah.
'Kay!
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is... Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
No no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus Hey Rach, if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Alright!
If I can't have it you can't have it!
Hey Jessica.
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Take it back?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Oh my God!
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and tender.
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you were saying?
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Yes!
Barmifsaed?
Yep.
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Like what?
And-and and and the toothpicks?
Ah.
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Yeah.
Delicious.
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
My whole family's from Naples!
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Who you what? Who you what?!
What?!
Hey Rach.
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Nice move.
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
I don't think so.
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Hey. It happened!
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Yeah, they're not coming.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Hey.
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, Monica...
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
How is Monica, I love your sweet ass, inappropriate?
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
Well I didn't tell them!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
They know you know.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
I'm sorry, I just... I like things the way they are.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
Funny one! That's good!
I have never known love like this.
Hey!
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
So uh, what's your name?
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
That's... kinda hot.
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Hey Pheebs!
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Yeah! and things aren't as... smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
Bikini, French cut, thong! and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Yeah.
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
No!
Yes!
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
I know! Alright, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Yeah! Me too.
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
Uh... Cookie?
What?!
No. Nope, I uh... I th I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
Oh.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya.
Alright.
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
You know you've been spitting on me?!
Thanks! okay okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
You went through my personal property?
Great scene yeah?
Oh, I'm not working tomorrow.
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Yeah, I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
Hair transplant.
Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
Yes you are!
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!
Thank you. Thank you.
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
I'm still on the set!
No! No, I'm the minister! Alright, look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
Yeah! You... you were wonderful.
That's what you told me.
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
Aw crap! Okay uh... uh let's do the rings.
What? What's going on?
Ah. Slow swimmers?
I'm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it's either this or a bathrobe! Look, what's more important, the way I'm dressed or me being with you on your special day?
I don't believe we've met, Joey Tribbiani.
Wow Dennis Phillips! That's great! How did you guys meet?
Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
Okay fine! I'm a seven! Alright, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I'll show ya!
No no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.
I'd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?! But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I'm sorry. and some scared memories Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I'll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple!
Well, I'd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you're casting for this new show...
Well I'm not proud of this, but...
Yeah.
Yeah.
No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga nut?
Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
Oh my God Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? 'Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
Okay.
Umm, now uh... It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y'know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Oh my God.
Ohh... I wonder if that dude.
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn't see who it was but...
You opened them all?
Well, I don't know. I think it does something to salami.
I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
Listen I uh... It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom. Y'know, I always felt like you and I have this this special bond. Y'know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me?
I understand.
There you go!
Hey!
I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here!
Bye.
You'll tell me later?
I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.
No that's not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
Yeah that didn't sound like me.
Monica's chicken parm! I'll take care of it. Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency. Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread.
Really?
Oh wow, I don't feel well.
I still can't believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
So it's noticeable huh?
How are you doing?
What?
What?!
Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys.
and you won't blame us for any damage?
Hey!
Hey! You're back!
Y'know what? Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
You're welcome buddy.
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin' to that place.
Oh I think we do.
Personal thing? What personal thing? I don't know.
Hey.
Whoa, for like months?
The sky's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
Okay. Now you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
Have a nice six more months Ross!
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
How long since you've seen a girl naked?
No! No! No Ross! I'm not hot! Are you hot?
Alright now... Alright, you're all set up. You're good to go. Just hit record. Alright?
Yeah?
Y'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!
Loud and clear!
Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Are we watchin' the tape or not?!
How do you know about that story?!
Ken Adams!
I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV!
Hey you too!
Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?
Here we go! Here we go!
Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
I said no.
I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
Hey!
It's no Ukrainian film.
No
Hey! I'm an actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
Alright, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!
Dude! What is going on?!
They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?! He's not you!
What do you mean?
Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?
I know, but I don't think that's what she wants.
Hey, I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!
Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up.
That hot girl from their wedding?
Hey!
Okay. I'm Chandler
Hey all right, Ross came as doody.
Exclusively.
But between you and Phoebe, I'd have to give the edge to Phoebe.
I'm not sure.
I would say, Woman, please!
Okay, here's a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.
Hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
So you think Ross too?
Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
Rach?
Okay, if you say so. Alright, ready? Set! Go!
You're a weird lady.
That's not so bad.
Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas... and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they're hungry or sleepy. Y'know, kids are tough. Good luck with that.
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you're not gonna be on TV!
But Rachel has an apartment.
I guess I didn't really think about it.
Oh, okay. I... I ate way too much.
I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.
Y'know I blame Ross for this.
Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, so that the baby has privacy, and and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh Oh look! Here's a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
I'm loud!
Hello!
Yeah! Alright Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay? But, it'll also be really... really great. Please Rachel! I really want you to stay.
I know! I found it on the street.
I don't know.
Ooh! Ah! Okay!
It's a grand tradition!
Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
Hot?
Will you let the lady talk?!
I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby...
Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party. Okay? Y'know? Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun.
That's her! Okay, come on!
Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
Yeah, that's one naked hooker!
Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny.
Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?
Alright, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
I don't want to. You do it!
I miss this.
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like... things are different.
You got it. Come here.
Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
I just want you to say it once in a while.
Phoebe!
She is?
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
That's right! 'Cause I'm a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but dammit! We can eat!
Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
Oh hey!
Oh. How big is that?
Seriously, who is this guy?
You are my Everest.
Alright where's that turkey!
Well that's it. I'm done. Whew! There come the meat sweats.
Whoa hey what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
Oh hey Rach, listen Hi!
no no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y'know, to give her some advice.
Okay, so will you meet with her?
She took 'em!
My little sister Dina!
Hey! It's my fashion girls! What's wrong?
Is that a sandwich?!
Well obviously this is a mistake! You can't be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
You got pregnant for funny?! Dina... if he's funny... laugh! Alright, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!
Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman...
Oh you'll take 'em!
Ahhh! I heard I do, we're halfway there! Okay! You!
No they can't! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
You were right. He is funny.
So whoa whoa! What are you gonna do? You're gonna have the baby and raise it by yourself... without a husband?! You can't be a single mother alone! You're gonna ruin your life!
One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
Because! 'Cause... 'Cause you're my baby sister!
Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
Come here!
I'm missin' picture time?!
Hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!
You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.
Then why did I ask?
Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Good night.
You're Rachel!
But plus, it would be wrong and weird and and bad.
Do you wanna do it?
This conversation never happened!
Get back in there!
Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm...
Ooh, great! Thanks!
Hey, y'know what?
Yes I do! And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and giant baby heads stretching out...
No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.
Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so... nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
Ah... Hey, so this roommate of yours... is he good looking?
no no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
Oh whoa whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We're on a date.
Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you're so beautiful... I don't think I can.
That's your move? Boy Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
Yeah, it is. It's really tough. Y'know sometimes I think Wow! Nice move!
Yeah.
Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
Ah! Okay, well then you don't judge me. I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before.
Now you can't tell anyone, but uh... I put on shiny lip balm.
Why not?
Yeah. Why Yeah, that would work for ya...
Hey!
Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
Oh right!
Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
Yeah me too, all night.
No no! I'm fine. It's just... Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then suddenly... suddenly see them a different way?
Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Alone?!
Oh uh, it didn't work out.
Oh sure, yeah, why not?
Terrified.
Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!
Well, neither.
Alright. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that's different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Hey. Well, what's up?
Whaaat?
I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes.
What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You want to hear it?
You think?
Not really.
Why?
It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It's just a crush! It's going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
I love you.
Oh, I love you too.
What? What's going on?
Really?!
Oh my, oh my God!
Oh that's amazing.
Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!
Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel.
Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
I don't know. Ooh, I bet it's Richard.
I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y'know it wouldn't kill ya to respect your wife's privacy! Stupid closet full of bugs!
Absolutely. But, we're gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I'll page Ross on the way. Come on.
Hey! So?
and there's no danger to her and the baby?
Well what do I know?! I'm not a doctor!
Oh hey-hey!
Hey uh, what's with the candy?
Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! He brought Twizlers!
Then why do you throw like one?
Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think... I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
Oh, I just... I feel terrible.
Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Maybe you two should live together.
Alright now, so? What do you think?
Hey.
Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before. Y'know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y'know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y'know? I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way. I'm uh, a lone wolf. Y'know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What's a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!
Bye.
Thanks. But maybe later.
Oh, okay.
Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! Well, you're cute, but you're not too smart!
Hi.
C'mere. Hey. C'mere. That's Rachel. She's the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you we love her. But we can't have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You're a guy. Well, you used to be.
Hey.
Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right!
Rachel stuff.
No, no, no, no! He's fine! Look, look, look! Here's your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?
Sort of.
Oh, I... I d
It's nothing.
No!
Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.
No. I don't think so.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, yeah.
There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y'know? 'Ccause we're really good friends.
Oh, I don't know.
It's Rachel.
Yes. I like Rachel.
Yeah, but it's not a big deal.
Look no, I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? these these are just feelings, they're gonna go away.
Hey.
Oh what then? Kick me?
Oh now Hey Ross Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh... I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
Yeah, I thought you knew that.
Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
Are you sure?
Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. Take a couple deep breaths. Look confident.
Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
Okay. That's good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah. Don't you people ever knock?!
I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
Uh... How long have we known each other?
But over the past few weeks...
I'm not quite sure.
I'm falling in love with you.
Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don't have to say anything. you uh, you take as much time as you need. Okay, you gotta say something!
yeah yeah right. That's okay. That's fine. That's uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it's no big deal. Alright? I think I'm gonna go.
Sure!
Oh no no Rach, please, don't be sorry. Okay? Don't be sorry. Y'know I was only kidding you.
No no, I can't! I can't! Not after the other night, it's just it's... too weird, okay? Don't tell her I'm here! Don't eat that!
I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
Yeah. Okay. Whoa! I almost forgot this was on your...
Hi.
So you uh, have a... big work problem?
Yeah?
What?! Oh my-oh my God!
That's crazy!
Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
Hey!
Let's just say I took care of it.
What?! Why?!
You lied to me!
I know. I know.
Me too. I mean I... haven't thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn't feel the same way about me and how it was really awkward.
Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.
Hey!
And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
I know
Why?
I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy.
Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That's me! I'm blank!
No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
Fine! Alright, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid.
Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
And I'll have all the muffins.
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Thank you. Wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am...
Dude! What are yo you trying to kill me?!
In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I'm also a mento for the kids. Y'know a mento, a role model.
Matter of fact, I do.
Nothing! Well, I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
I like it.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Alright, what are we havin'?
I'll take those to go. For the kids.
Well, I said that I...
Okay.
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
Yeah! Look!
Alright, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.
I think face to face.
Alright.
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Oh, I do. How you doin?
Not much to tell there I'm really shy.
Bye-bye. I did it!
Oh, good to know. So close!
Little bit, yeah.
Hey, you're the one that loves the picture.
yeah yeah, and if I get it by day I'll Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I'll be Joey Trrrribbiani!
Oh really? That'd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
Yeah, isn't that a cool name?
I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
This is embarrassing.
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris... Holy cow, that's a big word. Trisc... Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?
No! No, fear of the number 13.
Alright. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
Choose, you jackass!
In what John Houston film would you hear this line, Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!
Yes!
That noise can only me one thing.
Yes! Yes, you're back in the lead!
Of course!
Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
Now, over to Chandler.
Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you've been Bamboozled!
Rightie-O Ray!
Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You're in Paradise Pond!
Let's play Bamboozled!
Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, I'm sayin' it 'cause it's the truth. You're food is abysmal!
Okay, I'll see you there.
I thought you already have a job.
What is it?
Either eat it, or be in it.
Hi.
Cheese makes me thirsty.
I can an A? In-in school? Hey, I'm a dork.
Whoa-whoa whoa! I don't want to go. I'm having fun.
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade, and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher this time.
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
Uh-huh! I know. I'm coming soon to a theater near you! I'm in THX! I'm unsuitable for children!
I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you're all invited!
Hello?
Oh my God. So that's it?! I only get to bring one guest?
You said you didn't want to go.
Well uh... I think I want to take Chandler.
It's not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it's it's everything. Y'know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn't believe in myself.
I'm gonna go shave.
Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? There you go.
Okay, this is it. It's my big fight scene coming up.
Which part exactly?
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
Hey! Sleeping beauty!
Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You've done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?
Ah-ah-ah! We're doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
Okay, so that's another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that's...
Alright, what else?
What the hell are you talking about, The south will rise again man.
Okay. Okay, so I'm writing you a check for... So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
You're ready to have a baby? My boy's all grown up!
God. He's crazy! Why doesn't he want to be with Rachel?
Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
Alright.
Uh, you gotta press the button.
Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information; I'm a doctor.
Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!
And what is his name?
He's not really my type.
You do attract some stinkers.
I know, but I'm a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
Date of birth?
I'm a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
Oh that's terrible. I'm really sorry.
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?
Uh, well he's 33.
He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he's not into anything weird sexually.
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
Right!
There she is!
Oh no no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we're good.
What was the other one Ross?
What is it? Hey!
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Yeah, I guess so.
You don't have to worry about that okay?
My God.
Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I'm really more of a candy guy.
Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no.
Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand...
I guess.
She said yes.
Oh, I like that. Yeah...
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll come back later.
We're not peeking?
Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.
Dear Lord.
Y'know, I don't really know her.
I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
You're right. You're right. I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I'll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there if you want to check that out.
No.
No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
No, I didn't!
Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn't... I didn't propose!
No, I didn't!
Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
It wasn't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
Dude, step up! I proposed.
I can't believe you're not going to propose!
Ah, it's beautiful.
No, Rach, I should've told you sooner. It's just that... Man! That kid is going to town!
This isn't the right room, sorry folks.
You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story.
Is he still mad at us?
See this is what I was afraid of, I didn't think I should be here either but somebody said he'd be over it by now.
Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn't even do anything wrong.
Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this I don't really know what that means. You were saying?
No, come on Ross! Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
You should scream at me, or curse me, or hit me.
A little bit.
A little bit more.
Hit me.
Hit me, hit me.
I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
You were supposed to duck! Why didn't you duck?
Hey, so how is it?
You, you want me to help you with that?
It's pretty, Okay date of birth?
Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
But you two were supposed to be together.
So?
Really?
Hey, for what it's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just anybody.
You know, ah, I've been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it's not my fault. It's a natural instinct.
How long do you have to go for?
Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
I can't believe you guys are moving.
Uhuh.
Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.
Yeah!
Hey!
Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?
Mike.
Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... There's no guy in there!
Okay!
Atta boy!
From school.
What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!
What?!
What are you doing? I said seven! Argh!
Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. Mike! Mike!
Good night!
I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
Double promise? Call me when you land.
He had to board.
Alright thanks, Oh hey have you talked to Chandler?
oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
didn't till just now.
I said I think you're hot and now I'm embarrassed.
look I don't usually ask out women that I meet in coffeehouses
really, great, did I actually ask you?
yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that last piece of cake at the restaurant.
AWCH! That's why.
listen to this... I went out with this girl last night and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.
yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know.
HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST!
What?
Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
I dunno!
my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?
Thursday? But that's Halloween.
I know, u-uch.
No, they're comin', we're waitin' right here.
Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's still some food left on their place, okay, what's the restaurant's policy about people eatin' that?
If you ask me to stay, I'll pee.
Thank you. Waiter! 'lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails.
That's a great story-can I eat it?
Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Son of a bitch!
No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want.
Well, what is going on with you two?
See ya. Well, this is just us.
No-ohoh.
Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
That's the best birthday ever.
Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!
I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
Nooo! Being funny is your thing!
Fire trucks!
Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is...
Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...
Yeah...
Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.
Me! I'm up for puppets!
I am learning so much from you.
Did that guy really make that joke?
Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!
Yeah! Right! People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird. Or... or maybe just a wing or...
Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
What?
Hey dude, what's up?
I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
How did she get me to settle down?
What? Whoo... What?
Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.
You don't wanna see what I just saw!
wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.
Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.
Yeah.
I.. I.. I need a good lie.
I do not.
Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.
Oh.. man..
Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrific actor.
I can't believe I won.
Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me... And they all got to meet Santa!
Oh.. My sister's raccoon.
Setting the table.
What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.
Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.
Uhm... Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
Yeah. Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
Hey! Open the door. What's going on?
Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.
Dude, come home!
I don't know how to tell you this but, uh... I think Monica's cheatin' on ya. I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
I just heard him!
I heard him again!
Absolutely. You'd do it for me. Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied.
Alright. Alright. Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh? Bwa-ah-ah!
Why do I smell men's cologne?
I guess not.
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife? Huh? Do you think I'm like, Duh.
Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.
Thanks. Here's your ticket.
Where are you going?
I love my job.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?
Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
Okay.
If you want I could loan you some money?
Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
No it is awesome!
Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?
Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight.
Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word puppy. Okay, so he said: If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass.
No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!
Okay.
Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.
No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.
I'm surprised to, but yet here I am.
Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?
What?
I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother.
And you're not helping?
Yeah, you too.
Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
Why not?
Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
Fine.
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
Fine ... mediocre porn
Oh ... Happy birth ... oh, see you later
Oh, I didn't go to college.
Will the stable boy never get the princess?
Ok
Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I should have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
Hey hey! You dye your hair!
Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
OK Thanks.. I touched the stuff
Oh good...
Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face! I'm all right! I'm all right! Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK Dammit! Woman! How Hooow!
Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped
Alright, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so I don't look stupid for my pictures.
What, what.
Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don't know if I can take anymore plucking. It hurts so bad!
Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
Listen that's a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
Hey!
Your eyebrows look weird.
Fifth day's a charm.
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
Really?
Wow, really?
Ooh, names?
Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.
Why are they doing this?
I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.
Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.
Ooh, that's a great plan!
Hey.
Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
She even reads for pleasure!
I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Ooh...I hear that's bad.
Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
Hello?
How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?
Because you two were having sex!
Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
You almost had me.
It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
Where?
I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?
Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
Hey!
Who did?
I did?
With Lennart Haze?
Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word.
Yeah, he's done some amazing works.
Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
Tell me about it! Unlimited nights and weekends!
Yeah.
Wow!
Err, I think you know.
I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't.
Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern I could go right now, maaan!
Yeah.
Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.
I give you $500 for them!
I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?
Actually, I really need...
I think you know!
I could go right now.
I did?
Hey!
Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
I need an answer!
I need an answer now!
You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for? Bang? End Scene!
Hey!
Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
Oh...how much?
That's right I am!
Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs! or er.. Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again! Huh!
Oh, women can. You can't.
Hey!
Yeah, I know.
That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
Err... Kind of.
Something personal.
Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
Because she is!
OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Hey Ross, check this out! yeah, I can't do that!
No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
aaand SEND!
Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?
Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
But he's the same.
You're not the same!
No, sorry haven't seen him.
Alright! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
It does?
Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.
How do you think I got him in the first place?
Alright!
A place to eat spaghetti.
Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.
Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
What's that now?
I was?
Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
Look who's coming around!
By you!?
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?
Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
I'll show you how.
Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!
No, no!
And what did she say?
Hey, that is so great about the job.
Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.
Me too.
God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do.
Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!
You don't love him!
Oh, what about this one.
Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?
Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop.
Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
I can't believe you married him.
How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.
Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
Hey!
I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
What?
Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
So...I've never played that!
What the hell are you talking about?
Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
It's a one-woman play called Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life.
I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
Hey!
Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
I didn't have to tell you that! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!
Yeah...
You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
What party?
Nice to meet ya!
Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
It's a science.
Monica!
Ah, let me see! Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
Hey!
Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?
Heeey!
Can I offer you a drink?
Hey, if you need a tour guide...
Ok!
Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.
I don't think so.
I need to talk to you about Charlie.
No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...
EH, what do you know!
Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
The Metsss!
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Ok.
No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means you're gonna get eaten by a bear.
Come on! you...
You're ready?
Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... I made it work.
Oh hey Rach!
Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
What's the matter, Pheebs?
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
Alright, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
So, I don't have to learn what that means?
Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Well, just wake him up!
Wow! You look... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
Mmh-mmh.
Alright, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called The Days of Our Lives.
You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at?
Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
Hey!
You could say: Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?
Will you wear a thong?
Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
Oh man!
Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in
dammit!
It's really gone?
Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
I know we're not, but Frank Medeio and... Eva Trorro... womba...
In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
There it is, you're blushing!
Tell me who it is.
What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
Yeah.
Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
Night.
No, he really said it.
Yeah, and so funny!
Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
Yeah... I think we do... about what?
Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
Ok, Rach!
Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... What the hell is my problem? OH!
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
Ok! Alright, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
That's a huge thing!
A MONTH?
What the hell are you doin'?
CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!
Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross!
NO! no no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
No idea what it means.
Is he gone?
Well, he's with Charlie now.
Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
I like although!
Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
Let's forget about Ross...
Well, maybe I can help.
Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
I understand...
Ooh...
Hey!
You kissed.
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
Yeah... Now I have something...
I am those things, yeah.
I can't think of anything.
I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
Hey!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so-ooory.
I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
Good night!
Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
Ross?
Probably.
Really?
Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
In a carriage!
So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
Dude, are you okay?
Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
Morning. Here you go.
No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
I think so.
No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
Yeah. It's actually our first official date
It's OK!
No, no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.
I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won't be going back there!
Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
I don't get it, Chandler loved it!
Uh, was that good for you?
Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
This thing welded shut?!
Sorry!
Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
uh uh!
Soldier down!
I don't know.
Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
That's a... pla-an.
I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.
So...
Yeah, me too.
Hey!
What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
I'd love to! Yeah!
Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?
Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!
You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!
Um, my present!
But equally real!
Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!
Uh, why, it's a... one of her favorites, uh, Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression eesh! Love you forever. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.. And while he rocked her, he sang I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.
I'm so confused!
Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
No.
Nighty-night!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.
Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
Hey!
What? You never said anything about an audition!
Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!
Way to go robot!
Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!
What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!
Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... Dear baby adoption decider people...
Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
Always nice to meet a fan!
Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart! No, no, I'm... brainy, bright, clever, I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!
Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
Yep!
Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
Ah, look who's back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
You slept out here?
Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips! I don't need that kind of talk in my house!
Yeah, Monica made us!
I'M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
Yeah.
Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!
Whoo-hoo!
Hey!
Hi sweetie!
Cool!
What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold! Huh? Come on! What can't I do?
I'm cold!
What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!
Damn it!
What's up?
But, ehm... you watched the tape?
Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
Keep going Pinocchio!
You still here?
You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .
I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
And?... AND?
You're mean!
What's going on?
Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
What's going on?
Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.
Ok, ok!
Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore...
Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
Oh.
Center ice.
Dude, two times that happened!
That's some gentle comedy, dude.
Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
Okay.
Wow
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
Alright. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
Who do you think its from?
Ah-haah! I win!
Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
WATER BALLOON!
I'm telling ya... I can do it.
Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
Don't make me come up there!
Sorry!
Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!
Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
Okay.
Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
I left them at the park.
Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
Man, I've got food all over me.
Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys R Us... She was in stock!
But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
So... who's your friend?
Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.
I know why I don't remember her, huh?
Growth!
Saraaah.
Stupid Gap on every corner!
Well...
Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...
ALL FOOD!
JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!
Looks like someone IS the ladies!
oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours.
How about those fries though, huh?
Oh okay..
I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean There are things you do..and you now, things.. that you don't do .
Well, stuffed clams.
So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy.
Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
Really?
Stop staring at me!
Oh-oh!
So, why are you still wearing it?
Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can't believe he would do this to Monica!
Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? Because I can stop doing that, I really, really think I can!
Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
A meatball Sub? Thanks!
Hey guys!
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! Only better looking and richer.
Noo, more like a notebook... Damn it! Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either? Woha... hey... In high school, I once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the...
Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
Paper, snow, a ghost!
Salami, anchovies, jam!
Chickens?
Ketchup!
Oh.
Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?
Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? . Yeah!
Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. Pass. Pass. Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.
Yeah...
Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
Things that burn.
Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.
Oh, oh, oh...
Where?
Yeah.
Seriously?
Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
Oh, hey, my pleasure. So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
Strike two!
Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
May I have a word with you, please?
More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal.
That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
I'm glad we had this little talk.
Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
I don't think they are.
Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
Yeah?
Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
Ok.
Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
Got it.
Oh, de fuff!
Hi.
Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
je.
pel.
mah
Me pooh pooh!
Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! . Pooh.
Thank you.
Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
Right. Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
Ah. Alright. But my French was good?
Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
No.
That I can do.
Guess what? I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
No, thank you.
You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that thing. What is it?
Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. Hmmm...
Ow!
Oh.
Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
Yeah, maybe.
Just when I thought we could be friends.
Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
What?
What? I get my own room?
Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
Hey bear, I need some career advice.
What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
Hey Phoebe.
There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason.
Ok. Why?
Hello?
Yeah, actually I am!
No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.
Yeah, I just... I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
Why?
I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.
Estelle?
No, no, no! Don't drop by, don't drop by!
Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. out of area. Boy, I'll say.
Alright, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
dammit!
Try it, I can't feel a thing!
Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
Hey.
Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
I really made you think about that thing uh?
Alright, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
Come on here, have a seat.
If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
A little more, a little more. A little more... Alright. Okay, all right, let's do this.
Doesn't work...
It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
Oh my God. You and Rachel?
So, so is she still going to Paris?
I bet you did!
Oh my God! What did you say?
Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
Could you get me a muffin?
It's a... It's a welcome home sign for the baby.
Why not?
Damn it!
Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
Hey, maybe that's for the best.
Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. Right?
What?
Yeah, you are!
But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?
Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
Oh!
Just put it on a plate and leave.
Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
We gotta get them out of there!
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Oh God! So what do we do?
Does that mean we have to bust it open?
Alright, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine.
Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
I need to say goodbye to the table first.
Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
I could get a goose!
Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
I love you!
So did you guys make it in time?
Yeah. I guess so.
