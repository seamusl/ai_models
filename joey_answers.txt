Instead of...?
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Who's Paul?
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
Which goes where?
Hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
You got screwed.
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
I will not take this abuse.
Of course it was a line!
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
Yeah, right!...Y'serious?
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.
I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.
Whoah!
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
That's ridiculous!
What are you talking about? Keep it!
Let it go, Ross.
Chandler! He's here!
Alan.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Do you have any respect for your body?
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
Probably kill myself!
You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
So?
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
What?
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
What?
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Really?
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
You don't say.
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
What?
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Which what?
Oh my god.
So, you and Angela, huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
What?
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Alright, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Who's Rick?
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!
...I'm his
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Thank you!
Me?
Well, I'm I'm showering.
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
I got fired.
My mom will.
Hard to tell, I was naked.
Hi everyone.
What's up man?
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
It's never gonna happen.
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Are you going to do it?
Good luck, man.
Hey, where are you going?
Because of... the reason.
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
You'd better act surprised.
Sorry, that was wax.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Twice?
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
What?
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Hey, hey.
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Thanks.
We did?
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Oh. What?
So I guess you all saw it.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
That one will.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
You call that delicious?
Oh, I will.
Ahhhh, I didn't get the job.
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Uh, four.
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
Hey, kids...
There y'go, kids.
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Alrightalrightalright. There.
C'mon, she's your mom!
Yeah.
In Bizarro World! You broke the code!
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Ross, how could you let this happen?
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
So are you gonna tell him?
Uhhhh... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
What are you mad at me for?!
Ah! Huh?
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Then she came back with The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
That's the rule.
You knew about that?
Yeah
Why, are you moving out?
Aw, I know all about Kip!
So what's it gonna be?
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, Uh-oh, I'm outside again? Of course!
Alright, how about the ladybugs?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Hey!
Oh yeah!
Dad, dad.
Sure. So how long you been...
...I d'know.
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
What's the matter with Rog?
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
Dad, Ronni's here.
No you won't.
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
You really think so?
What's the matter with you?!
Oww! Big ring!
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
I'm...happy...for you?
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Think it'll work?
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
How do I look?
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
We can't do that.
Uh, we might be leaving now.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Whoa.
If you don't do it, I will.
So what're you going to do?
So... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
mmm. Good.
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Vulva?
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
...yeah... what else?
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Come on! You like this woman, right?
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
You're not going to believe this!
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
So, er... how did it go with Celia?
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Yeah, where the hell is he?
No, no... how come you are working here?
I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's... hot!
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Nope.
I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Pheebs?
So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there.
Hey.
Oh, no no no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
I don't know. I like her, you know. She's different. There's uh, somethin' about her.
Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
Yes.
You meant sex, right?
He should take the sack?
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
When's that?
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
Hey.
I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
Oh, Urse...
no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
I know...
Pheebs?
Hola, amigos!
Shut up!
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
Heh... I was bluffing.
...Yeah?
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
What?
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
'Tonight' tonight?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Marcel?
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Marcel?
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Duh, where've you been?
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Maybe she never got your message.
Get down!
..Naughty!
Oh my.
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
Alright, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Hey! He beat ya.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Did you call the cops?
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Marcel, I'm hungry.
Holden McGroin.
I don't know. What are you wearing?
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Services? Oh, services.
Oh... Yeah, you do.
Alright.
What?
Stegosaurus!
They're here already?
Alright, all right.
Alright, I'm going. I'm going.
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Oh, yeah.
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
It is.
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Oh, just had a baby.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
... It's a fertility study.
We make fire. Cook meat.
I don't know, she's, uh... she's pretty great.
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Hey!
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Then you do. Heh, heh.
Not following you.
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
The country.
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Sure! Why not?
Shhhh!
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Seven hundred bucks!
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
What up?!
Needs some clothes altered?
You know, I think I was sixteen.
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Can we see her?
Ooh, that bad, huh?
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
What? That's not? Oh my God.
I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Chandler?
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Who?
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
Yeah. Bijan for men?
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
I'm gonna do it.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, whoa.
Such as?
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school
What?
Have you been here all night?
Alright, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Geez, look how fat she got.
You want his yearbook?
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
What happens if you flick it?
The Ice Capades?
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do... so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
Me too, we should get goin'.
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
Alright.
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying let's go here, let's go there. Like we can afford to go here and there.
Hi.
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
Sorry, sorry.
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
Yeah.
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Thanks.
Charity.
Me too.
Come on you guys, one more time.
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
And we don't work hard?
Let me get that. You got five bucks?
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
Is he gonna be ok?
Hat, milk, got it.
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
No, seriously.
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Yeah.
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
Heads.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if y'know what I mean.
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
You're getting a cat?
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, Excellent butt, great rack.
Hey Phoebs.
And?
So, so how did it happen?
Wow.
This man is my God.
Cool.
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
You could say that.
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Oh my God.
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Y'know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing y'know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me...
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Hey.
Yeah, big stuff.
Sure is.
How far'd ya get?
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Rach, these are for you.
Uh-huh.
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Here it is, here it is. The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.
No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.
No, I'm alright man. Really.
I just had a glass.
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him 'cause he made that list about you?
No.
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
I've never slept with someone for a part.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
Alright... I've got to go shower.
Are you really not going?
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
Hey, look who's up.
It just seems so futile, you know? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
Ah, the stalker.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
Yeah it is... what?
No one.
Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
But that's what...
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
Hey Erica, c'mon in.
Who?
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
'Cause it's a television show.
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
Woah, dude, burn.
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of... no guys around, huh.
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
Ma?
Are you naked in there?
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing.
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.
aaagggghhhh.
aaagggghhhh. Mommy
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Heh, what d'ya say?
Put it on.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
Hey.
Get out.
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
Some girl ate Monica.
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
Uh-huh.
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
What if we have to pee?
Hi.
She laughed at you?
No, inside good, outside bad.
Is that the fire alarm?
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Yeah, so.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Hey.
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Huh?
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Well then maybe I will.
Hey.
I know. Yeah.
Plastic spoons. Great.
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
Well, it was a fight... based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, y'know, help me to grow or... whatever.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
Thanks, yeah. I love this but y'know what, it makes me wanna pee.
Right, I go-, I got it.
No no no, behind it.
Yeah.
Hey!
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, y'know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
Hey.
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Yeah, yeah he is.
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
Huh.
So how you two gettin' along?
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
Page 42, page 42, page 42.
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'

I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
I don't feel like talkin.
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
No, that means nothin to me.
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Anybody want a croan.
No, can we get back to me?
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
I'm sorry. See ya.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
Oh my God.
Ahh.
What?
So what.
Yeah.
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
Ok.
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
I fell down an elevator shaft.
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
I went.
What?
Oh, not my parrot.
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
Hello.
Hey no problem.
A little foos?
He paid a lot of money for it.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
I don't know.
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
No problem. Hey Chandler
He-he-eyy.
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
We're the guys.
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
Oh yeah.
Not a dad.
Freaky.
Who said it was for you?
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
Hey, hey, hey no.
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
How come those?
Good.
It's a woman.
Hard to say.
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
He-he-he, how's it goin'?
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
'cause she uh, she steals stuff.
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
Yeah, I've had it.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
What a phony.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Karen.
Really?
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
Alright. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother There'sa, not a good mother.
Come on, I need your help here.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Come on, Chandler, I want this part so much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him...Hello? Hello?
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Good morning.
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
This is Janice.
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? Alright who's first? Huh? Ross?
Wheel!
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
No, Yeees. God, how do I say this.. Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair?
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
But what does that gonna do...
Does it have to be a whole day?
Hey!
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Alright they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
We have a half hour.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Whoa!
How is this your seat?
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
Alright! You can have the chair.
I'm so sorry.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Okay.
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
You could drink the fat.
Let's see what else he'll do!
Hey.
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
Put your hands together.
Check it out! Jam crackers!
Let me see. Oh, right.
Nooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Where you going?
So you're really doing this, huh?
No kiddin', hmm.
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like... Hoyt.
He's got the body for it.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
Can we please turn this off?
Hey!
How is it you?
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
I love that movie.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs...get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
Come on baby, come on!
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
It's okay, these things happen.
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
I didn't get it?
Oh.
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Wait a minute.
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Hey!
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
Eh! There you go.
Ooh, very official.
Because it's faster.
So we are going on two?
Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Well, that's really a different question.
Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
Hey!
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
Oh, you bet I am!
Whoa, ah! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
Lifeguards.
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Cool!
Booo!
Guess what?
Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
I know!
Hi!
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
No.
Ahh!
Hey! Oww! And I'm bleeding.
Okay.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
aww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
Well, I might've said supergay.
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
Hey, Ross?
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
They were in his office.
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
I know.
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Well, now we got a reason.
Hey uh, what's a matter?
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Alright, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
Alright now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Says who? Your mom?
Thank you.
I got it.
Haaa! Hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
Hi-hi, I'm Joey.
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
I think so.
Oh, yeah, that. Alright, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Fumble!
Alright, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
After!
What are you gonna do?
Here you go!
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Whoa, whoa, no, no, I'm not playing with this guy, now.
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas...
Alright.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Hey! Hey!
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Hey! I got great news!
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
And now for the great news.
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Okay, pick a card, any card. Alright, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
I can't tell you that, no.
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Hey! Hey!
Come on!
Mary Angela.
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
She's right in there.
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary Angela?
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
Alright.
Alright, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Who?
Oh, okay. The what?
Really? Thanks.
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Done.
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!'
What?!
Bye.
People, people, people.
Cool.
Hey.
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. Alright? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Okay.
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Alright I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Hey! Mine was by accident! Alright, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Beth is really, really sick.
Yeah.
Wow! This girl is good.
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
Hey.
Ooh.
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Alright! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner...
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Morning.
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
Yeah.
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
So Pheebs what's this guy like?
Yeah!
Both of us?
Uh, 10:30.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Yeah.
Ah! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
So what are you gonna do?
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
Alright, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
Yeah, I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Don't answer that.
She was nothing compared to you.
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
You think I need a new walk?
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
No, I really have to pee.
Okay, may I see the comics?
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler...
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
Oh yeah.
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Oh, now I have to go!
Relax okay, I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
And there you go!
Okay, done.
Arrrghh!
I can't handle this, you guys.
What?
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
Why can't I find that?
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Alright, congratulations you lucky bastard!
Hey!
Every night!
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
I hate this woman! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like like laughing at me.
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Better?
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
Get out of here, really?!
They gave me the shaft all right.
Alright.
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Do you want me to want you to care?
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
What?
Okay.
Ah, are you okay?
How do you mean?
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
Something like that?
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
Hey.
Y'know, about what happened with us.
Nooo.
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Saw a girl with that vest.
Hey!
It's cute, huh?
Hey.
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
What?
Ohhh, here it comes.
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
Hey!
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
What 'cha doing?
Are you sure?
Wait. Give him a minute.
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight.Who who got what?
But you said one.
Okay.
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
So, so, what'd ya think?
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
No, they weren't in the play.
Anyone mind if I save this?
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Oh, you didn't see the Post?
Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Kate, do you even like me?
Thanks.
Hey!
Oh, it was great! Yeah, I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!
you think?
Yeah?!
Where's Kate?
Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
I'm coming up!
what's going on? what's this about L.A.?
Well, so, stay for the museums!
In a minute!
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
Well?!
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, aww, he's got a Ross.
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
Whoa-whoa whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
Hi, how ya doing?
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
So you're the gynaecologist?
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
Yeah. What are we getting?
Hey, the fight's starting!
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
That you're actually 50?
Hey!
Woo-hoo! Alright! Yeah!
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
Come on! When you go away, you have to play, it's like a law!
What?
Fan out! Fan out!
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game!
What?!
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn't go out with a guy like Chandler...
Oh-oh! And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don't know what happened there either...
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
Oh no! No! My hole!
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
You're gonna have to pee on it.
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
No?
It's between us and the sea, Ross!
Alright.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
Alright. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
Oh. What do you do?
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
Pretty nice?
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!
How's that going?
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!
Yeah...
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Aww, man, he took the five of spades! Oh, no no, here it is!
Hey! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I knew what he meant.
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
He cut off his ear.
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
Spock's birth control.
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
Oh, I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
No he doesn't!
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
I have actually not heard of that.
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
Well he made Rachel cry!
Alright, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Come on man, just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
What, what is it?
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
No no, thank you.
Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
Come on man, you're not a potato.
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
No I didn't.
Alright, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
Alright.
What?!
Look, you wanna use our place?
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Go get 'em Treeger.
No, I'm good.
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
yeah yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Okay, I see what's going on here.
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Is she great or what?
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Well then, do it better!
Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
Why?
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Why not?
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
What kind of smell?
You wanna see her again, right?
Yeah.
Alright! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
Our place, the hall! I...
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
Hey!
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
yeah yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Who's Elaine?
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Yeah?
Hey dude, it's me.
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Why?
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Oh-no no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
No no, Kathy.
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
You do?
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Who?
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
I don't know! But it's the same!
Over the line?! you you're so far past the line, that you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
Hello.
Alright!
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Yeah!
Alright. But if you weren't my best friend.
My folks.
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
What's twisted?
He's fine!
Hey!
You kissed my girlfriend!
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
I'll get it.
That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
Open the box!
Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
Alright, I'll see you guys.
Okay.
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
Well, we could do that!
Yeah!
Yeah! Alright? Let's go!
So, we're having fun, right?
Are you serious?!
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
Yeah, I know.
We're 29, we're not women.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Sure! Where are the seats?
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
Hey!
Hey.
You got it! Oh-oh!
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
No ma'am.
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
That's crazy.
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Look, Ross, really it's it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
It's the chick! She's... going through some changes.
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Alright, we'll start with... apples.
Okay, the last thing...
Serious?
Huh.
Animals dressed as humans.
It's All Relative.
Althea!
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
Look, we are not gonna...
Ooh!
Big fat goalie.
Everyday use.
Uhh, 11!
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
Hey ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
What?!
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
There's gravy?
Hey!
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
No no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
Oh yeah, who's playing?
I don't know, it smells good.
Come here.
Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.
Hey, how you doin'?
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
Whoa-whoa, that that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
What's ready?
Oh yeah!
Guggly worm.
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Hey!
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how's he doing?
Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. Alright, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! yeah yeah!
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
Interesting.
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
yeah yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
Oh no no, you don't understand...
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm
I don't wanna.
Yeah, all right.
I know what it did! Nothing.
Sure! It flushes it.
And there it is.
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Hey, what's going on?
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Okay, Ross, look look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
Alright, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's... Chandler!
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
No.
The Red Ross! Okay.
Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
Oh, wait wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
aww!
Now that's a thinker.
Pastrami.
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
yeah yeah, yeah, with that that uh, plumber girl...
Welcome to America.
Phoebe, what are you doing?!
Alright. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you you'd just be eating my animals.
Okay, time to take off the bra.
Ooh, what you got there?
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural 'causes, I can have one of those right?
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill maybe this is how they punish us.
Why would he turn off the TV?
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Yeah, he likes porn.
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
Then you go to Tokyo.
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
Nothing. No, nothing.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
I think you're right.
That's kinda nice.
Yeah.
Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
No, but I'm gonna!
Someone you didn't make up!
Alright look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! Alright? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
So I guess it's Joey then!
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
So, you're just Bing?
See you later, Gene.
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
Come on!
Oh come look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
We don't make enough fun of you already?
What?
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Whoa!
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Oh.
Ooh, I like that.
Alright!
What's the game?! What's the game?!
Oh.
Okay. Okay. Ace!
Okay.
Why?!
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
I don't know.
That was one good minute!
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Monica and Rachel made out.
Okay!
Oh, you should here me.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
You can't do anything!
Yeah, well...
I am... free!
Joey Tribbiani.
What?!
Hey you guys! What's happening?
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
I know. Ross is getting married.
We could climb Mt. Everest!
Yeah!
We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Yeah we are!
Don't answer that.
She was nothing compared to you.
Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, Handkerchief? No no, I got my invitation.
Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
Heyyy.
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Hey!
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
I'll never get to be a best man!
I can't believe you're not picking me.
Hey!
Thanks.
Nooo, later.
Are you bachelors?
Then you're not invited.
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
Yeah?
Oh, little party favours, check it out!
Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt.
Yeah!
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
The stripper stole the ring! The stripper stole the ring! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. i...
Alright, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
I'm so worried about him, y'know?
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
Really?
It's all London, baby! Here we go.
Ohh!
London baby!
Bye, Pheebs!
Come on! Do something!
It's London, baby! Alright, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
Really? To what?
Hey!
Well, I like it. Here you go.
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Hey.
Me too.
Sh-shh-shh!
Oh, Chandler.
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and and... Hey!
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
No, I don't think so.
Ahh, the babies miss me?
Two pizzas?!
What's in it?
Your different here too. Your mean in England.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
Ohh great!
Okay.
Right!
Have you seen Monica?
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
Hey, Felicity.
Fuggetaboutit. How you doin?
Ohh great! Hello.
No.
Well, that went well. Yeah.
Hey, what's up?
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
My Giant? I love that movie!
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant. Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Thanks man.
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Alright, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Okay.
Alright!
Was his name Angus?
yeah yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
That was good beer.
Later!
Say that to him and you're golden.
See ya! What the hell was that?!
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Alright, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Phoebe!
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
I gotta get the before shot!
Ooh, something hurts!
Oh my!
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. Alright, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
Yeah, I was bummed too.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
Or?
Whoa-whoa! no no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
Argh!
They're so small!
He's talking to London!
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like like you did with the babies.
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Well, may I ask for one example?
Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
But I'm the host!
Hey Mon!
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
PBS telethon.
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Come on man! You've been here all day!
Hey Pheebs!
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Monica? What time is it?
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
How was your conference?
Hey, you're back too!
What are you guys woofing about?
You want my advice?
You got married to fast.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Y'know, I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! Alright, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
Oh! Ohh! Oh!
Ohhhh!
How?! When?!
But it is a big deal! I have to tell someone!
Aww, I don't want to see that!
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
I can hear that!
Hey!
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
I'll take it!
What's the matter Ross?
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow! He's not even here!
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
You do have a choice! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
We all hate Emily!
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
RACHEL PLEASE! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!
It's almost as if he knew.
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
What happened? What happened?
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Okay.
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
You're fake laughing too, right?
Nothing.
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Sorry.
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Alright, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
Um-hmm! Look, I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
YES!
Hey!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
Mine!
But it's available now! Isn't it?
Okay!
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Yeah.
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
Yeah!
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
Hey!
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
Definitely!
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
Hello?
Look.
I put it on to scare Chandler!
It's Joey.
Sorry! Sorry.
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
You're a dork.
I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Yeah, it was! Alright, listen, I can't...
Alright! But, you do it with me once.
Hey, Pheebs!
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
You're smart. I like that.
Hiya.
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
Yeah, I like that. But no no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Alright. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
What?! No I'm not!
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Ahh oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
That makes sense!
But sadly I could not be enticed.
What are you doing?
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
But, I love you.
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
She's a woman!
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Wait a second, I could star in it!
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Done!
Oh.
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Alright, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Uh yeah, right here.
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
I didn't finish my five pages.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
Hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture I didn't have my camera!
They're brother and sister!
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Okay. It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out. Ross
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Alright! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Alright, I'll take care of it.
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
Okay, great!
Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
Yeah!
Alright, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Really?Who who have you taught?
Nice! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
Umm, okay.
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and...
Yes!
You look like a freak.
Yes! Yes, I did.
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Your other student, was you!
Hello?
Okay.
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Umm, do you see any oh, Vaseline?
Ross? You okay?
Well, I'm just if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Oh no, no no! I don't want to know!
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!
Hey, Pheebs?
Wow! Cool!
Howdy partner!
Oh, no!
Now? You want me to go over there now?
I might know something.
I can't tell you what I know.
You don't know!
Yeah, I know!
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
I don't know.
Ohh, I know one thing!
Hey Ross!
Alright! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Alright, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
dammit Phoebe!
Alright. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Yeah!
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Yeah.
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
Great! Thanks, Rach!
Are you all right?
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Really? A purse?
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Alright relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
Well, first it's not a purse.
Alright look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Yeah but I didn't read anything.
Hi.
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Hey guys!
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
no no! No no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Ugh.
Well I didn't tell them!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
So he likes to break stuff.
No.
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
Dude!
Dude! He's right there!
I call Godfather!
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
Oh sure, right back there.
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? she's hurting me.
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Yeah, big!
Hey!
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Huh.
Nah.
She's right y'know.
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Hey!
Dark red.
Alright, I'll see you in the morning.
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
No no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Hey! Oh.
What?! Why?!
Alright! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two-ish.
It doesn't?
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like like you guys have?
No, never done that either.
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
... is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, Who are my friends? You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
I'll treat you real nice.
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
What happened?
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
dammit! Did you move?!
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
Okay, pick a card.
Is that your card?
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Done.
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Alright!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
At least I care about his feelings!
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Hi!
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
Okay.
No! No! I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. dammit!
Yeah right!
What you do mean?
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
I'm in it.
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
no no, that that's me, that's me.
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
Hey! Is the show still on?
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
That's right!
I'm comin' out!
Oh, yeah, good idea.
Right over there! Right there! Look-look!
You got to go on a ride along?!
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Yep!
Yeah, okay.
Half the taste is in the smell! you you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Are you thinking about Monica?
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
You okay man?
Yeah, I didn't know that.
Dude! How come you took off?
Okay.
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I... knew... you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
I know it doesn't make much sense...
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
How good is that?
Oh-whoa hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Oh, I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
What the hell is that?!
It's not a cat!
Uhh, the ball thing.
Okay!
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
I don't know.
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
That's right baby.
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Did you get your money back?
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Me too! Me too! Me too!
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
Alright! Thanks Pheebs!
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Great! Problem solved!
Yes!
A swimmer!
Ascot!
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
Sure, what do you want to see?
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Hey! You ready to go?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? She's been dead for ten years. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
You got it!
Anybody want to say goodbye to me at the car?
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
You wanna eat? My treat!
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! Alright, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
What?!
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, i'd rather be alone.
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
Get out!
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Hey! Stanley! Hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
You're kidding right?
Uh, hang out?! How long?
Yeah.
Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Uh, well yeah yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. Alright.

Ooh, so close.
Hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
yeah yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Let's ride.
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
I found my identical hand twin!
Alright! Hey!
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
Right! Okay.
It's me, Joey!
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!

Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been cancelled.
I don't need that anymore.
It'll be great! we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
Hey.
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, Ross. Do not say, Ross.
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
Alright. Alright.
I wanna rock and roll all night!
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
That is incredible! You are the master!
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
Hey Monica!
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's? Can't, its not there.
Hi.
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Wow.
Oh-oh, what about Ross?
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
I don't know! How about, Thanks for taking the message. Jeez!
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
Everything on your application looks really good Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, Oh that's okay. You'll find someone. And then, bamn! She finds you!
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
no no... It's okay, I mean I look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Hi!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Very good! Okay. G.
Ooh, sorry! no no, so close though, but bye-bye!
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Hey! Any good mail?
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
... look both ways before you cross the street.
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I lost my health insurance.
Bastard!
What?!
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Hey!
Sure, now I'm scared.
Okay. Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you.
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
Thank you.
Hiya!
Take could care of your Momma son. Take could care of your Momma son. Come on son! Your Momma's good people!
Okay.

Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
Great! Thanks.
Yeah, it's mine.
It's got 'em!
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Okay, take it easy.
Oh I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
Yeah, so did I.
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
Hi! How are the Gellers?
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
And that's every month?
Oh my God!
No! Forget it! Okay I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. Alright, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
Hey!
I've got Ben.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Okay, you're on.
You serious?
Okay, here we go. Ready?
Nah, not my game.
I don't know how to play Cups.
A two and a five.
A four and a nine.
Damn! I am good at Cups!
Uh, wow, 700.
What?
Hey!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! you you're trying to give me money again!
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss... is you. And now the dog.
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Oh, hey let me.
When can you move in?
Oh God, yeah.
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
no no, it's it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
What?!?!
Hey.
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
It is?
No.
I'm a man.
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh... Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's... too girly.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on... and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
Yeah, well, it feels different.
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
What?
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
Great... Great... and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Y-sure!
Chandler!
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Oh I am!
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Dude, they're not objects.
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying?mmm? and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Really?
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goood.
No it isn't, I ate that.
Hey you guys.
I like her so much!
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
What do you mean?
no no we came together!
Hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown? I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
3, 2,
Hey!
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
I came over here to tell you guys.
Okay.
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? she kisses better than my mom cooks!
I was tired!
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
See ya tomorrow!
what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
No no, she really is sick!
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
I know! I know! Come on, please please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
Come on you guys, come on please please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
Hey!
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! Alright look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Well, this this this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
Alright, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
Yeah!
Pretty much, yeah.
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
You're right! That did cheer me up!
Whoa-whoa whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. Alright? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
Not so much.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Just being friendly.
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Yeah?
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
See, now it's weird again.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
So, you'd hire me, right?
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
That's great. Thanks Rach.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
Hey, how you doin'?
Great!
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
Sorry!
It's just I can't because my manager said I... Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
What? No no it's her birthday!
dammit!
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
You wanna make it 6?!
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all! You're dead inside!
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
I don't think so.
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
Phoebe's a porn star!
Alright well, I'd better take that back.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
You sick bastards!
Hey!
Nice!
You do?
What is the matter with you?!
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
Wow!
Hey.
Really?
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
Alright! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
Hi!
She's not crazy is she?
Hey there you are!
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Alright, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Alrighty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Did I not just tell him?
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
Yeah you did.
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Morning!
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
why?
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Alright!
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I...
Wow!
Just okay Did you do it right?!
But you got to be with both of them, right?
Yeah, you don't want that.
You got a little bored?
Sounds good.
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Yeah?
Well, where was I?
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
But it's $2,000.
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
Pizza! We like Pizza! Get out!
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
That's us.
dammit Carl!
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20 year old.
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
Hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. Alright? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
Oh, how bad is it?
Hey listen...
Hey listen, so when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
I know!
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
Hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
Ah whatever!
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
I know.
Hey, here you go.
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
Hey!
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs Oh!
Great! Roomie!
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Ooh! So close.
Huh.
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Give me $400!
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
You pushed him!
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Call it even?
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
Hey!
Ahh, to be 13 again.
No! I won't leave you!
What?
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or Mac. Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or C.H.E.E.S.E.
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
You really think so?
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then I'm his butt.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Yeah, whatever.
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Oh, it went amazingly well!
And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
Yes! Ha-ha! Alright! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
I said name one!
What message?
I can't believe this Chandler!
Oh, well I'm uh...
That's mean! You really had me going there!
You hug me!
Yeah.
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Okay.
How do you do there, Wayne?
This is like the temporary robot, right?
I'm sorry, it just I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
What do you need?
What are you in love with her or something?
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
Oh man!
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
Alright, let's get me back up there!
Dry cleaners?
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! that's offensive to Russians.
Uh yeah, where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
Whoa-whoa whoa, I Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
Hey Gunther.
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Hey.
No.
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
Hey!
Yes, it's in my... In... in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
I know!
Ooh! Freeze him out.
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
Oh my God!
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
Where's all the tissues?!
That sounds perfect!
Hey!
Where are you going?
Okay. Have a benefit.
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Hey!
I guessed 20,000!
I didn't know it was an auction!
I don't know! Charity?
Just out of curiosity, how much is that boat worth?
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Okay.
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
Aw-aww!
No way! It's mine!
Who cares?! I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!
Yeah.
We didn't ruin it!
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Yeah, Big Brother.
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Maybe you changed?
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. and always will be!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
You got that from what I said?!
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
I know! They suck!
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
Okay.
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
Pick me!
Okay that's fair.
Dude!
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
I am so sorry man.
Yeah!
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
You guys don't think I look 19?
I was afraid of that.
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Wow thanks!
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Yeah! Once.
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman! Alright?! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!
You guys kissed! Oh my this is huge!
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Seriously?
Aww crap!
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like like, You look 19, and then they just take it away like like, No you don't.
Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
Who wants French toast?
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Yeah I did!
You got porn!
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Gotcha.
The vicar!
Alright, I'm sorry. Rach I Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
I did?
Hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
What?
Feminine.
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Alright.
Uh, boat rope.
I'd say, come again. No no, wait I know this one, I know this one, uh...
Yes.
Hey.
Women are mean!
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
You won't boss me around anymore?
And you'll be topless?
Ohh yeah.
I don't know why you just don't say left.
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Alright that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Well, hey I did learn.
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I know port is right.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
What else?
What are you doing?
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
Mom, so what did you think?
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Well, these really are the days of our lives.
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
Hey Terry!
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Y'know Terry, I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
Hey.
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. cancelled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. Alright, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?! Alright, bye! They cancelled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Hey! Terry.
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Alright, I guess this will be fine.
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
Alright, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
I had a donut.
Yeah! That guy's all right!
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
What?!
I don't know Rach.
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Yeah, for you!
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
What are you talking about? Bitch.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Alright, well uh, I'd better go.
No! Never! Never! Bye.
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Hi.
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!
Okay! When?!
I want to do it again.
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
I don't want to marry Chandler!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
Okay, Phoebe...
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Yeah.
Alright, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel dammit!
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Great nap.
Morning!
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Hey, who's your friend? Hey!
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Okay, good to see you again.
So, system kinda broke down huh?!
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just I don't see it going anywhere.
Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Alright, so we should go catch our movie.
Hey!
What party?
Oh, and how is Allison?
Hey.
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Okay.
What about Game 1 of the Series?
Hey! You wanna go?
Hey, thank you so much.
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Where are you gettin' this?
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
Yeah?
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Alright. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Yeah that dog left!
Told ya.
Half hour.
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Alright, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
You think?
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
Hey Rach?
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
Yeah lady! Give us candy!
Waiting for candy.
That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
Hey.
No! Drums!
Thank you. Hey Pheebs!
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Is it back in the cage?
Alright, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
I'll see you at 8:00.
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
The Ross Is that back?!
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Hey!
Huh? Uh...
What?! Tonight?!
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
y'know y'know what I really want?
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
No, I'm gonna! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like like like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
Well, she graduated from high school!
Fine!
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I... remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Alright, what are we havin'?
Check out the rack on this chick!
Ross!
No! No no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
Right-right up here.
What?! Alright Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
Come on!
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Oh whoa whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
I don't know Ross! I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? you call it in the air, all right?
What? No! No Ross! No no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! Do you want soup or salad? Both! Always order both!
Yeah!
I think face to face.
Alright.
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
Hi.
It's not that far! Just drop!
Hey.
Why would you want to do that?
No. No. No.
As in Rosita does not move.
Is there a problem?
She's not even cold yet!
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
Francette? What is she? A couch?
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
Miracle!
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Fine.
My chair heels itself.
Your chair?!
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
That's right!
Oh yeah.
Hey!
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
Well actually...
Yep.
Will you quit hoggin' it!
Yeah!
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Yes!
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
No.
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
And-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
That was a great scene! And-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Say what?
An-an-anyway I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
Oh uh, one of the writers.
Okay.
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Joey.
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
Yeah.
Okay! Alright!
Oh well Hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Like like what?
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, Boy, she is a great actress! Uh but, I am also thinking, She is hot!
yeah yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Okay, bye-bye.
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I am so sorry. I...
They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
I don't think so.
Thanks!
The airport?
That's a really long time.
Good luck.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Well then let me do it!
no no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
So I can do it?
Okay.
Hey!
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Now now, listen this is just a first draft so... We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share. Eh? It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving. We too can share and love and have and receive.
When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and... And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
... by doin' it.
Yeah! I call that London style.
Yeah baby!
Yeah baby!
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
Ah.
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Yeah baby! No baby!
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
This is crazy.
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and we see you together and it just... it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
Really? I can do it?
Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
So are guys doing okay?
Here you go.
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
Oh yeah, I added three.
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
Boyfriend?
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
Oh.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Yeah!
Oh yeah?
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
yeah yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
That sounds fair.
Alright, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Hi!
Hi!
A woman in a man's body.
So you've just married the one time then?
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
When do you think we lost her?
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
No no.
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
Many are scheduled to appear.
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
What award are you practicing for?
Yeah!
Yeah. No no I know I might not win, but it's just... I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
You practice losing the Grammies too?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Ross has a boyfriend.
Problem solved.
Yeah, I got my speech!
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
What the?!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, I behalfin' it!
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
I can scratch that right off.
I'll take it back tomorrow.
Okay wait wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Well, that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
They loved me!
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
Hey, I'm back!
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Wow! Sure! That's great!
So... What?
No. What?
Nope.
That's right.
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Unless what?
Wow! This looks great!
Thank God!
Well maybe we just take that one away.
Ow!
The fruit roll up.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you what?!
Hello!
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
You got me. I don't...
Well-well see? Parents are comin'!
We should really learn how to play the real way.
Hey!
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
Okay...
Why are you taking this away from me?
Hey.
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They... feel a little unwanted.
Come on! Look just tell let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or no no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show Wedding!
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
No! No, I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Alright, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
... when I look back over our time together...
Hey!
Has it been that long?!
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
No.
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Ooh!
It's not my first time.
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
Hey.
Hey!
What? I don't get it.
If he goes first he can!
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Hey!
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Pheebs!
Well, when Jake did it I saw that... he was wearing women's underwear!
That's weird!
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
The silk? Feels really good!
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
Hmmmm.
No, I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
No!
Nooo!
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well,who who was in World War I?
I'm doing my scenes with you?
I think you did.
We have to find the rest of the platoon!
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No no food!
Hey! Where have you been?
Yeah.
Great! Alright. I'll see you later.
Oh man! They just redid my make-up!
Picture? What picture?
But you're spittin' all over me man!
Wow! Didn't know that.
What picture?!
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Thanks a lot.
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
I'm having surgery!
Transplant.
It's not on my head.
Are you drunk?
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
dammit!
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
So I got your car, it's right outside.
no no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
Chandler?
Yeah you do!
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
I can't! I don't have any other clothes here.
That's better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it.
Wow, I've admired your work for years. you you've done some really amazing stuff.
Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? 'Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would've done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that's just for ugly people.
Uh, I don't even really know where I left those. Sorry.
Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
Hey!
So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?
Oh, see that's where you're wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn't see it up there, just try me.
Shh. Shh. Don't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be okay.
Tell me about it, I feel like I'm holding down the fort all by myself.
Hey!
Nothing! It was something.
Hey!
Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant?
Whoa, wait a minute. Who's the father?
David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!
Okay.
Oh good, uh you're here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I got something I want to say.
Why?! Why can't she marry me?!
Now I can't believe it! What? Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father?
Yeah.
The guy left this.
Oh hey! You got my parent's gift!
Yeah. what did Tag say?
Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this.
Pheebs, give me the ring back!
Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered...
Oh my God!
We know its Ross!
Well that, that sounds good.
What secrets?
Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
Why would they take away our keys?
Hey, I washed those!
Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
Please, just, just go and talk to Rachel.
What the hell is that?
Huh. So then I can heat this up?
Oh my God! I can't believe that!
Well, what did you say to her?
Whoa! Hey! Whoa! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
Hey Monica it's Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin' from your apartment.
How? I guess I could break down your door.
Uh, okay I'll break it down.
I don't see the baby. Where is it?
A couple? Like two people? Like one , two people?
Hmmm! Yeah nice necklace!
Whom. That's right.
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
Alright! I'll have a sandwich!
Y'know what? Don't worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.
Yeah I knew what you were talkin' about.
Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
Six months? Whoa that's rough.
Okay. Okay. Umm... Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty.
Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe...
I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw... a beautiful woman... bathing herself... but she was crying...
Hey! Look, if it didn't work it's because you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it.
I'm not feeling it.
Well you're not selling the story! It's like; it's like you don't believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition. Okay? I'll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and see what you're doing wrong.
Good luck.
That means a lot to me man.
You're right.
Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.
Uh no Rach, he's gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
I'm so happy!
Some guy!
Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
No, couldn't care less.
What? You weren't in it.
This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
Hey!
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
What? I... I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great...
No. No. But I'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
I set her up with this actor on my show.
Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!
Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
So what movie do you want to see And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
Why?
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?
No, I said fun!
No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not...
Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre no no! Slutty Leatherface.
Yes I did! I'm Chandler. Dude, what happened?
When have I ever done that?!
Yeah.
Catwoman, hands down.
Are you kiddin'? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She She's not standing right behind me is she?
Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn't matter.
Here comes the temper.
So Ross?
Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
Hey Monica! People came to see a fight, let's give 'em what they came for!
Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We're waiting! Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. Oh wait wait! What does the winner get?
Or equally weak.
Hey!
Come on! You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. Y'know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
Alright, well finish your coffee; let's go.
Oh, you're switching apartments?
She is?
Hey!
Ooh. So umm, I was talkin' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
No room? It's a baby. It's like this big. Y'know, I mean you could you could put it over here. Or we could put it right here. Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby?
I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.
I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had.
Ahhhh... that's really just to show where the baby would go. Y'know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion?
I'm up all night!
Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby, then maybe I don't want to be with that woman! Or maybe we'll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
Ohh!
Yeah.
Ew.
Isn't that great?
This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How's it going?
I'm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
Yeah!
So you uh, nervous about getting married?
How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
Uh, that that's that's me!
Why would she go in the bedroom?
Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do.
I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
In a minute!
Hey! It's your bachelor party.
You do it!
No, I miss hanging out with you.
Oh sure And hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just... I miss... hanging out... just us, y'know?
Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! What gives you the right to... Go to hell! Stupid guy on my phone.
You fall for it every time!
What?!
No they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!
Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin' chips is like stretching.
Who the hell is this guy?
That's it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
It's like me when I was born.
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
Oh yes I do. Otherwise what's next? Today I'm just a guy who can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just... I just I gotta change my pants. Jeans have no give.
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
No just, nobody press on my stomach.
Ah, just cut me a little sliver. A little bigger. Little bigger. What?! Are you afraid you're gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin' to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren...
Oh no no, she wants to talk to you!
Great! Thanks! You're gonna love her so much. And Oh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y'know the S.A.T's?
Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
This is so exciting for her. Well, I'll let you two fash... ists get down to business.
Oh. What's, what's going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad's heart? Is that a sandwich?
What?!
Bub! I can't believe this! You're the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
I can't look at you right now!
Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man...
Hey! You don't get a say in this!
Well what am I supposed to do?
Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, that's not a compliment!
No! No! No! It's different for you. You're so strong and together. You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
Maybe! Well! Well... so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts Oh forget it! I can't!
Well I'd be scared of them, but all right.
That's right! By his uncle too!
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
Congratulations! You just got married!
Who was that?
Oh, what's wrong?
Is that college talk for horny?
Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
I can't do it!
You're my friend!
I know!
Alright, me neither! I was just testing you!
Good night!
Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya...
Why don't I take you out?
I'll be fun.
And, a brownie! Well, half a brownie. Actually, it's just bag. It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so...
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Y'know what? Bring her both, and I'll have the same.
No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don't like me for I'm sorry I couldn't even get through that.
Well it does when you combine it with, This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!
Alright, so... so tell me one of your moves.
Queens.
I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance y'know I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.
Where'd you grow up, it's so simple!
Yes I am! Again so simple!
Chandler?
I never laughed so hard Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
Huh. Huh.
Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didn't say raspberry before did I? Alright just tell me Rach, just tell me!
Oh. Yeah. Me to.
Oh yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?
Oh yeah? Alright, let's do it tonight.
Yeah.
Oh yeah yeah, the lobster.
Yeah well that's because uh... I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.
Yeah. Yeah, that... that's exactly it. You're right. Yeah.
Oh yeah, sure. Ehhh.
Hey, did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car and Cujo's throwin' himself at the windshield?
Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
Alright, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.
Alright. It's a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don't feel that now. It was crazy! You're fine. You're better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything's normal! She's just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.
Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I really need to talk to you.
I don't know. it's it's just... lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!
It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
What?
Oh my God. You do?
I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
She made me switch to light Mayo. That's it! That's all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings.
Hello?
What are you guys doing in here?
Alright. It's a new day, and it's just a crush, that's all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, it was cuckoo! Everything's going to be fine. It's just a crush.
Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we're almost there! We're almost there!
That's always appropriate! Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!
aaah...
Oh, y'know what? Maybe uh, you... you should come to me. I'm a not, I'm not wearing any bottoms.
Mia Hamm?
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
A dreamless sleep.
Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
Why not?
Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she's having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
Oh hey whoa whoa, don't worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything's gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. Oww crushing bones!
So but everything is normal.
Calm?! I wasn't calm! I've never been more scared in all my life!
You sure?!
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
Oh hey, don't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal.
Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Sure. Monica.
Yeah.
What's going on?
I'm on it!
Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
The thing is... 'cause I live with Rachel I'm here for a lot of the stuff, okay? And Ross... Ross is missing everything. So...
Oh no no, no no I love living with you. It just seems that... if you're gonna have a roommate, y'know it might as well be the father.
Well, I was due.
Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it's a couple weeks past it's expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.
Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?
There's one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that's never going to happen!
No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
Thanks so much, Pheebs! We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! Oh! Not that kind of fun.
Did I just throw this?
Oh, that's, uh, that's Phoebe's friend's dog. I don't know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.
So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
No.
Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
He's breathing!
Hey, what's up?
Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day.
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Forget about it. It's no big deal.
Okay, uh... sit down. Um... there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh... it can't happen.
Yes.
Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends.
Yeah, he's the best.
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I
It's Rachel.
Yeah, he's the best.
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I
Yes.
Yeah, okay but look, buy uh Hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.
I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross Ross don't...
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Bite me?
Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don't...
Anyway, it uh... look it'll just... take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so...
Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, Ah, I'll get over this. Y'know? I just It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do?
But what if uh and I'm not saying she will be But...
Hey thanks.
I'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say? Oh!
I uh, I just came by because I want to talk to you about something.
Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I... want to have dinner with you tonight. That's all.
What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason... Is it hot in here?
Yeah. Sure.
Uh-huh, long time.
Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Yeah, here we are. Uhh... I... I think I'm... falling in love with you.
Does it really matter?
But.
Don't start doing that. You can't do that Rach, 'cause then you're gonna make me do that. Oh, here we go!
Hey, hey! You can't. Okay? Ever!
Oh God! That's Rachel!
Yeah, a naked bagel game? Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole.
Alright so, so what do I do?
Hey.
Hey!
Huh. Okay. So uh, I think I'm gonna take off.
Yeah?
What he wants to buy your baby?!
Okay, how did this even happen?
Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy's not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
Don't worry! Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely, You don't go buying people's babies, so back off!
And you couldn't think of anything else?!
So? what happened?
Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit.
So, who's the guy?
Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I can't do it with you guys watching me!
Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.
I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing.
Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him.
what?
I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.
Yeah. Y'know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
Nothing...
Yeah you are baby.
Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
Yeah.
Actually, I didn't know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn't have mattered, I'm doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do... so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray.
Well, there are so many things, it's hard to pick just one.
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Right.
Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goood.
Not anymore.
Uhh, I don't believe in these crazy diets y'know, just everything in moderation.
It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn't have said. But believe me, that's not gonna happen today.
You guys, this is Shelley, she's interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends...
No thanks.
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
I know.
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you!
Really? Me? Wow! I don't even know any huge gay people!
Face to face, yeah!
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Hey Pheebs!
Great nap.
Hey! How you doin'?
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
What?!?! Oh dear God!
Oh great! Great! Thank you.
Oh, I don't watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y'know?
Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
Oh yeah, that's just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
Oh no, I can't go. I'm practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
But the audition's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game.
Alright! Let's play Bamboozled!
Alright. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don't you tell us a little something about you Ross?
Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
Alright Ross you're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question.
This one right here.
Alright Chandler, you're up.
you must choose Mr. Bing.
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross's points!
Correct! There's a possible backwards bonus!
Wise choice, how many rungs?
Okay, it's an audio question, name this television theme song.
Alright! Alright! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
Who invented bifocals?
Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
Are you sure?
It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.
Hello, I'm Joey Tribbiani! Let's play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
What Why?!
Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?
Man, this is bad! And I've had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal.
Hey uh Monica, I can't remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?
Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet ya. What uh How come you're not going?
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
You cooked him?
Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there's a new class comin' in.
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
Alright.
Yeah!
Hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go.
What the hell!
Oh, it's a poster for that World War I movie that I'm in, check it out.
Yeah, yeah, it's already generating Oscar buzz.
Sure! Why not?!
One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
Definitely not invisible.
Yeah! Yeah! I mean I'm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y'know Chandler always supported my career. He's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
Thanks. That means a lot to me.
A little tall.
I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along.
You liked it? You really liked it?
Oh no no, give me some specifics.
You fell asleep! There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions! That's for coming buddy. I'll see you later.
Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
Give me a number, I don't want to owe you anything!
Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
Please!
Which we're still keeping under our hats!
Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
Hey! You made it!
What?! Are you crazy?!
I mean seriously, she's like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn't and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and... I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
No.
Hey I got one! I got one!
Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
dammit woman we're losing precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?
816, thank you!
Great! Go get him.
But you said he was this great guy!
Hi! I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
That was a test. Good response. Alright, full name.
Age?
Okay. And uh, are you married.
Yes.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
Ooh, wrong answer.
A widower.
Rachel's having her baby! Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist.
Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if would help if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
Me neither.
She looks so real! Y'know what I mean! She's this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and... uh-oh.
What's the matter now?
Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. What's the matter?
Rach come on, what?
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
Hey, listen to me, listen to me... you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that's not gonna happen.
Sure.
Uh... Look Rach... Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
No.
Oh hey but, before you guys do that I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
Dude I just did something terrible.
Because it kinda looked like I did.
It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
I know! I know it's awful.
Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
Now let's not get carried away.
It can't be me, I'm standing right here.
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
Yowsa!
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that...
Are you kidding me?!
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.
I can come back.
Actually, technically, I didn't.
No, I didn't!
Ahhh!
Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
No, I didn't!
I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
Well, this is awkward.
Oh that's right. There's a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
Y'know what you guys? I'm uh, I'm gonna go too. And uh, I'm sorry about everything.
Hey you guys I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
Why're you so tired?
Hey so where's Ross?
That's not fair! I can't do that.
Hey. Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
I said I didn't technically.
I know I should've. I'm sorry.
No, look, I don't know what else to do. I said I'm sorry!
Why not? You'll feel better! I'll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
Little bit.
No, hit me
Hit me!
Hit me! Hit me!
I couldn't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
Good, good yeah, maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes. Oops.
Your thumb? That's weird. You sure you're punching right? Make a fist. Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
Name? I know Ross but what's it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
Sure, May...tember.
Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you're gonna get together right?
Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
Wow.
And you're Okay with that?
Thanks.
Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this?
A year?!
We were gonna go see the Jets!
Here you are
I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me.
I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?
Poophack...
Oh my God!
No.
dammit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
MIKE!
Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
Okay, look...
Mike, 'attorney at law'!
Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.
Please, we're trying to have a conversation.
Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!
Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
You're leaving too?
Look at this. My two best friends!
Dude, you see right thru me!
Okay, bye.
Hey, this girl won't turn around and I can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?
how come?
oh and you know what you should bring the black see-through teddy with the attached garters.
hot not hot Hot!
that would've been better, I'll try that Hi I'm Joey.
gesundheit
seriously Gunther you should see someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could DIE!
do you have any cake?
Hey
well that's not even the weird part. I don't think she remembered sleeping with me.
and who's fault is that.
Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again and try to get past it OH SALT BLOATY!
No. wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
How could you not remember that we slept together?
come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had sex here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
Ooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me Hey! I still got it. so were good. I'll let myself out.
your right! I love my life! I actually did sleep with her.
So spooky, that's all.
What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.
Maybe we should just eat now.
But it happens? I'm gotta go to the bathroom.
Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hell-uhuhh!
Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.
Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ...
Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!
Chandler, control your woman!
So? Did have sex, right?
Do, do you gonna do it now?
Nah, just me. All alone. Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.
Joey! Joey.
Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet? Am I making you uncomfortable? If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? aaahhhh
Ooh. I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
Seriously? She actually said that?
Without that, you just got lame with women.
Hey!
That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Really? Do you not know Chandler?
...No...
Heeeyy! Hey!
Not knowing when to shut up...
Nooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
Allright. See you later!
Wow! You blow my mind...
It's like the cheapest college ever.
Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...
Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it.
Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...
Did you take that tape?
She hot?
Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...
Alright, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...
Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later.
Oh my God!
I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani. Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.
Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs!
No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.
Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said Hey don't eat that that's Phoebe's and he said.. He said.. Joey you stink at lying. What am I going to do?
Uh..
Yeah.
Pheebs, I still need some help here
Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?
I lie better then that, right?
Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it.
ooh Ooh..
Actually its not pies, its just pie.
Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?
Hey. How come you're answering your own phone? Where's your crazy assistant?
No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game... courtside!
Hey! How come the door's locked?
What are you... Why are you dressed like that?
Okay. Whoa, whoa. Why are there two glasses of wine out?
COME... HOME.
Alright look. If you can't come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna.
No. Alright, I'm going in.
Okay. Great. I'll see you when you get here. I'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.
Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.
Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry.
What's going on?
Yeah?
Alright.
Thanks man.
Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?
Rach, these are for you.
Uh-huh.
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!
Got ya.
Thank you!
Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?
Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.
She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.
Hey.
That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.
Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.
Nice.
He slept with you and then never called you.
Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!
Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?
You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.
Hey. So where's Mon?
You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
How do you think she's doing?
Sure.
So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right.
Yes!
For a walk.
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
Molly ... people don't study acting ...
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
On...?
Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
Arghhh! Double standards!
Chandler Bing.
Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
Alright let's just do this.
Hey, I need your help.
You may be a sissy but I'll still . Alright, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one eyebrow and now... they don't match!
What the hell am I supposed to do!
Oh my God!
Oh my God! I didn't feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around that sadistic bitch at the saloon
Thank you so much.
Comb my eyelashes.
Ha, oh, of course.
Morning, roomie!
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
No, hey, it's been great.
Wow! So, how are you?
Well, actually it...
Sure, I know lots of girls.
Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?
Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
Alright! Who is he?
She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
Oh my god, you're right!
What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
Ah, yes, The Plan!
Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
Emma? Hey! Hi!
You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
Hey, I gotta! Unless...
Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
Uh-huh.
We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.
Can you believe they're still not here?
We've been stood up. And we want our free crab cakes.
Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day... and I smelled bacon.
She did?
I don't know, but it sounds great.
Oh my god, that is great! That is for a play on broadway... and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.
Yeah, yeah, and directing.
I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone.
It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.
No, I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I think you were great in those commercials.
Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon...
Oh, yah, sure.
I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now.
Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a...
Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: 'How you doing?' You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.
I really doubt that.
Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.
Wooow It's like they're on fire!
Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?
But I'm bursting with u-hu!
Yes... ahahaaa
I am what you made me! You know what?
I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!
Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.
Probably wanna know what I'm doing...?
We gotta get more of that.
You know!
Oh!
Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get...
I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...But wrong.
And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
Oo...what's in the bag?
You're gonna do it?
The hardware store is right down the street.
I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
I am on fire!
Oh no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
Boob job.
Rach?! Rachel!? So I can't do anything I like?
mmm hmm! For your boob job!
Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!
Hey!
Dude!
Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
There you go sweetie... This isn't over.
No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!
Make the transfer!
But he's the same.
He's the same!
Original or crappy?
It's Monica, ok?
... she's being unreasonable!
Really? She... she loves me?
Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
A place to entertain my lady friends.
Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...
Uh!
I like those odds!
Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?
I did?
Ooh! Tough odds!
Did you get it?
I'll do it! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
Can't really say!
I won, hey!
Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?
Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
Oh!
Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.
dammit! anybody got anything?
And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.
Oh yeah.
Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?
Right!Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?
Also so gay!
Oh, wish me luck!
Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life.
I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.
Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question...
Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you.
Hey!
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
What?
but, but..
Oh man! I thought I got it all!
And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!
Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
Uh...well...just once...with you...
Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
Thanks dude!This is GREAT!
Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
Hey, here you go.
What's happenin'?
Stupid Jane Rogers!
I do it every year.
Yeah...
I can't believe you guys went for that one!
Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
Ok... I mean...
Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it Thanks for coming.
Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
What have you got there?
Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you $5,000 to get to level three and I don't feel any different.
Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
Me.
Gotcha.
Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious . That's not how she used it...?
Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
Come on in, how are ya?
Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go ohhhh!
Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
I know, yeah!
Which one, they all suck!
Ross!
Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
Thanks.
Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
Phonetically?
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on Days I had to say Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy.
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
Hey!
Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
Alright, have a good time.
Bye.
So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
Hello?
Oh! How's it going?
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
Then don't go!
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
Barbados!
I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!
That... never happens...
Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
You really should have been more clear about that!
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
No, why?
I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!
Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
Hey guys!
Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a Galaxy far, far away? .
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
Kate Miller it is.
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?
Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
Yeah, who is that?
Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Yeah.
He said erectus!
Erectus?
Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!
Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech...
Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
Hey...
Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
no no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
You like me?
What... for how long?
I just have one question!
Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!
Yeah, he had a paper route.
NO, NO! It can't happen at all!
I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... I'm sorry...!
NO BIG DEAL!
Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Pssst...
You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
I'm thinking about you...
What's wrong?
Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Yeah?
I saw you.
It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.
Oh... uh... look... before you...
Dude!
Yeah.
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
Yeah! Good night!
Stop saying good night.
Rach, he just saw us.
Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.
Yeah, but it did happen, so...
No, no, no!
No, no!
Ross..
I do like fajitas.
I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
Hey, Charlie!
Oh. Oh, thanks.
Uh, actually, that's..
Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
It doesn't look good, does it?
Yeah.
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
That's what I hear, yeah.
I'm crazy about her.
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
And we're okay?
Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
More foosball?
Yeah.
What's the matter?
Ok.
Rach, you sure you wanna do this?
Ok, yeah, got it.
Alright, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.
I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
NAH! I don't have another level!
Hey!
Uh!
Oh! yeah!
No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
Well, I know what's the matter with me.
Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
Wow... I did not see this coming.
I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
I love ya.
Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
18, uh?
And starting to think about settling down!
We were supposed to bring presents?
Yeah, but for a one year old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says El-moo! Yeah... that's a funny cup!
Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!
No, no, no! My talents as an actor!
Hey, I think Emma might like it!
Actually we prepared performances.
O K.
I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.
Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
Got it! Hey hey hey! Where do you think you're going?
Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
Ok!
Bye, bye.
Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in.
Hello?
What audition?
A monologue? I don't have.. I got it. Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
Right.
Come on robot!
Hey, good race you guys.
I've been here the whole time!
Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
Hey!
That's right, yeah.
I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
What did I just say?
Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
Of course it does! It's smart! I used the the-saurus!
Oh, 'They are warm, nice, people with big hearts'.
Why not?
What?
But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we're getting rid of her.
'Cause we will appreciate it more when she's gone?
Yeaah.
Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand write it.
Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... Okay, bye bye. She was nice!
She has a lot of crap!
Well, hey! Well... Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... I wanna say Mike? To Phoebe and Mike!
No.
That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
I can do that! Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use... Oh, what's the product?
Oh! Any word on casting yet?
Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
Thank you.
Just pass it to your boss!
Oh.
You didn't watch the tape.
Well, you lied again!
No you didn't!
Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... Stop lying!
Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.
What?
But it's an original Buffay...
GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
Now, what do you say?
Gladys?
Hey!
Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
Celebrity.
Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity?
Guys!?
Everything doesn't sound fine!
But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
I did not care for that!
I forgot my bat.
Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.
No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.
No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?
LAURA!
Three tickets to today's Rangers game!
Yeah, they're great seats too!
So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
Yeah!
I know, yeah.
Ohhhh! These seats are great!
I don't know...
How late are we?
Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
You are not at Thanksgiving?
Yeah, where were you!
Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
No. Here
I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
That's fire. Beats everything.
I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?
Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
Ha!
No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
Oh, that smells good!
It isn't working.
Interesting...
It's really starting to hurt.
Yeah! Come on!
Oh, I know how you feel...
I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. Hey!
OW, why, why, why?
Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. Mandy.
I can see why, nice shirt!
Hey.
Nope.
Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! Alright? Just don't order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That's a good way to lose some fingers!
I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I'll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. What were we talking about?
Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
You are beautiful, you know that?
NOW look what you did!
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.
Sure I do. Coule?
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
Why, just a tiny little...
I'm not even sorry.
Ooh... Not so good.
JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
You son of a bitch!
What?
No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! I'm gonna thump you!
What the hell are you doin'?
I'm really sorry you guys.
And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
What did they say?
Sure.
Seriously?
Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...
Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for. Ooh!
A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
A rock, a dog, the earth.
Paper, snow, a ghost!
Oh!
Relish!
Yeah...
Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!
My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes!
Oh, then pass.
I don't know. Types of trees?
Things that go tssst when you put them out.
Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
Pizza toppings, next!
Girls Chandler could never get?
Uh, hey.
So he can't come?
I am pretty wisdomous.
Listen, I hope... that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
Oh, a wiseacre.. No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
Hello Michael.
Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this.
I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
That was ME!
How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
Okay...
Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my resume;, I'm fluent in.
Je de coup Clow.
Je depli mblue.
Yeah.
Je te flouppe Fli.
Hey.
Welcome to New York City! Or should I say ghe deu flooff New York City?
Je do call blue!

What are you doing?
Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
Hey!
Sure, sure. Ok, Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu See?
For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
Dude, come on! French it u-up!
Sa-sa-saw!
Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
No.
Would fall off a lot.
Alright, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?
Hey guys.
But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.
Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
no... hmmm... it's not... hmmm
Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
I hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
Hey!
Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?
Hey, great! Alright!
Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.
I'm just mad at my agent.
Well I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
I love that saying!
I was just gonna call you! That's weird.
That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
I'm saying that... This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye..
I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
You blow me away.
Oh my God. Hello?
Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody.
Just flip!
Hey!
You guys hear a ringing?
Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
What did I just say?
Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. Wait a minute...
Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
Lucky bastard!
I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Who's that dirty old lady?
Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
A little more.
Yeah. Alright, now give me your best shot.
Hey!
Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
Okay.
Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
Hey!
Ross, wait!
Hey, you know what might help?
No, I sat in the paint.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
Hey, so what is the big surprise?
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
Really?
This is so cool!
Good luck, good luck!
Alright!
Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
You stepped on my egg roll?
Alright.
Oh! They're in the table!
Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Oh!
Okay.
Oh my God!
It did not.
Okay. Here goes.
Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?
Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
Hey!
